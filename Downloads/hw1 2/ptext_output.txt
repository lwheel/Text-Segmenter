Applications are invited for appointments as Beckman Institute Fellows at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). These fellowships provide an
opportunity for young scholars to initiate a post-PhD career of independent
research in an exciting and supportive academic environment.
The fields of research encompassed by the fellowship program include the
behavioral and biological sciences, chemistry, engineering, and physics.
Selection of Beckman Institute Fellows will be based upon evidence of
professional promise, capacity for independent work, interdisciplinary
interests, and outstanding achievement to date.  Preference will be given to
those applicants whose research interests correspond to, or have significant
relationship to, one or more of the programs in the Beckman Institute.
A Beckman Fellow will be appointed for a term of up to three years.  Candidates
for a fellowship should be in their last year of predoctoral training or in the
first year or second year of a postdoctoral appointment.  Completion of all
requirements for the Ph.D. degree is required before the fellowship can begin.
Fellows may begin their appointments as early as June 1993, but no later than
December 31, 1993, without special permission from the director of the Beckman
Institute.
During the term of the fellowship appointment, no teaching or other
administrative duties will be required of the Fellow, other than a brief
written annual report to the director of the Beckman Institute.  Thus, the
Fellow should be able to take maximum advantage of the opportunity to launch a
strong academic career.  On the basis of the experience gained during the term
of the fellowship, the Fellow should be able to compete very effectively for
academic openings in research universities throughout the nation, including
UIUC.
The fellowship appointment provides a stipend of $35,000 per year, and includes
a full fringe benefit package.  In addition, it will provide a budget for
support of research activity, based on discussions between the Fellow and the
director of the Institute.  Each Fellow will be assigned an office in the
Beckman Institute, and will be provided with clerical and other staff support,
computing resources, and access to facilities necessary to the Fellow's
research program.
Persons wishing to apply for a Beckman institute Fellowship should contact the
Beckman Institute for an application packet.
At time of contact, please indicate specific Beckman Institute research groups
about which you wish information (see below).
Deadline for application for full consideration: Application must be POSTMARKED

The Minority & Women Doctoral Directory is pleased to announce the third annual
publication of the _Minority & Women Doctoral Directory_.  The Directory,
available September 20, 1992 and published in two volumes, is a national
listing of minority and women doctoral students who have recently received or
are soon to receive their doctoral degree from approximately two hundred major
research universities in the United States.  There has been a 10% increase in
student participation over last year's edition, with the new Directory listing
approximately 3,800 Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Asian American and women
students in nearly 80 fields in the sciences, engineering, and the social
sciences and the humanities.   New for 1992-93 are listings for nursing and
architecture, and the Directory continues to offer listings for MFA/DMA
students in the fine and performing arts.  Each entry includes name,
local/permanent address and telephone number(s), ethnicity, department and
areas of specialization, date of completion, dissertation title, and name and
address of the faculty advisor.  This year's entries also include, when
available, citizenship and current employment/postdoctoral appointments.
Entries are indexed by field of study.
The information for the Directory was collected over late spring and summer
1992 to insure accurate mailing addresses.  Only those students from last
year's Directory who updated their listing for the new edition are included.
As in past years, the Directory is available in two versions: either as a
complete two volume set or as 58 separately available Departmental Rosters.
If you're interested in obtaining the Minority & Women Doctoral Directory, or
for information on being included in future editions, please write to the above
address or call the above telephone number.
The problem of model-based object recognition is a fundamental one in the
field of computer vision, and we believe that it represents a promising
direction for practical applications.  Realistic object recognition systems
need to be able to perform well with noisy inputs, and within reasonable time
bounds.
In the first part of the talk,  we present an analytical study of the
performance of the geometric hashing method in the presence of noise.
Geometric hashing is a representative of  a class of algorithms that
facilitate object recognition in a computationally advantageous way.
In the second part, we describe an interpretation of geometric hashing that
allows the algorithm to be viewed as a Bayesian approach to model-based object
recognition.  This interpretation, which is a new form of Bayesian-based model
matching, leads to well-justified formulas, and gives a precise weighted-voting
method for the evidence-gathering phase of geometric hashing. These formulas
replace traditional heuristically-derived methods for performing weighted
voting, and also provide a precise method for evaluating uncertainty.
Using the Concert/C language, we have implemented a prototype  distributed
object recognition system that employs our Bayesian matching ideas. The
computational platform is a small group of public workstations.
The resulting system is scalable and can recognize aircraft and automobile
models subjected to 2D rotation, translation, and scale changes in real-world
digital imagery. This is the first system of its kind that is scalable, uses
large databases, can handle noisy input data, works rapidly using readily
available computational resources, and exhibits excellent performance
with real-world, natural scenes.

The PC lab for CSE 110 students (Moore 109) will be open all weekend
(January 22 and 23) so that students can complete assignment 1 by the
extended deadline of January 24. The lab will not shut down in the
evening as it usually does, but will be open straight through Saturday
night-Sunday morning and Sunday night-Monday morning. Remember, as CSE
110 students you have TOP priority in this lab, so feel free to kick
off any other undesirables who might be pre-empting you (but politely,
of course).
The mean for the current weighted total is 71.
There was no assignmment given today (Monday Feb. 14); there is no
assignment due on Friday.  There is no homework help session today.
A homework help session for homework 4 is scheduled for Monday,
February 21 starting at 4 p.m. It should last no longer than 90
minutes. It will be held in Room 23 of the Moore school. To get to
Moore 23: enter Moore school from 33rd Street.  Walk in the direction
of Moore 109 (the PC lab), take the first left (go along the EE
exhibit cabinets, do NOT go on the ramp), go down the stairs, follow the
sign on the wall.
A quiz will be held on Wednesday, February 23 in the recitation sections.
Students who received between 2 and 7 points on the first tracing
problem of Midterm 1 (Problem 4.1) should bring their midterms to
their TA for possible regrading.
Due to a hard-disk failure on the PC network, only the hard copies of
assignment 7 submissions will be graded.  There will be no penalties
for late submission or no electronic submission.
Professor Kamberova will hold office hours on May 2, 3, 4, and 5 from
2 p.m. to 3 p.m., or by appointment (on these days only).
The PC lab in the Moore school (where the recitations are held) will
be open 24 hours today, 4/19, to allow students to finish the
assignment which is due tomorrow. At the moment, the electronic
submission program is out of commission thanks to hardware failure, so
do not submit your solution electronically. Please try to keep the PC
lab clean while you are working there tonight.

Dan-Air Services (DA)?  I don't think so.  You must have meant DL (Delta),
right? ;-)
I don't believe DL serves KIX.  DL does fly to Nagoya (located
approximately half way between Tokyo and Osaka) from both PDX and LAX.
Weren't fees at KIX adjusted to NRT level right before it opened?
The proposed 767-300ERY is simply too small for Trans-Pacific services.
I believe Korean Air has full intention to use its B(plus?)-market B777
for Trans-Pacific services.  Therefore, I doubt the ERY would be the
first ETOPS service across the Pacific.
There is no such thing as a 777-100; United is due to take delivery of
their first 777-200 (a -222, to be precise) on May 15th.
The delivery flight will be from the Seattle area (either Boeing Field,
more properly King County, um, International(?), where Boeing's delivery
center is located, or Paine Field up in Everett, site of the wide-body
factory) to SFO.  Initial service has been discussed at length over in
rec.travel.air, but the bottom line is that the first two flights will
be on June 7th, UA 921 LHR-IAD followed shortly thereafter by UA 910
DEN-ORD-IAD-LHR.  The next morning FRA will see its first 777 service
with the arrival of a flight from IRD.  I believe CDG and JFK and/or
EWR will see UA 777 service after additional deliveries this summer; I
haven't seen any mention of scheduled 777 operations at SFO soon.
Boeing hopes to deliver the 777 with 180-minute ETOPS rating.  United
really needs at least 120-minute ETOPS to make it practical for the
trans-Atlantic flights, though it's possible to do it without ETOPS.
The current 777 is a bit tight on range for the longer overwater
routes, though, with around 5,000 miles as the limit.  The "B-market"
777 will appear next year with considerably greater range, probably
close to that of the 747-400 from what I've seen.
No.  The 777 is already pushing engine technologies.  If the "super-
jumbo" is a derivative, it will be based on the 747-400.  Perhaps you
are thinking of the ideas for a totally new aircraft which would use
the 777's engines, albeit four of them.  For comparison, here are the
rough MGTOW in lbs of these aircraft:
At twice the weight of even a B-market 777, the NLA clearly needs a
lot more power than a twin is going to be capable of for a long time.
Here are the 1994 figures from the ICAO about the 30 leading airports
in terms of departures, arrivals and connections:
One airport clearly missing is Tokyo Haneda.  Note the fantastic growth
at Las Vegas.  It looks set to surpass Newark and possibly JFK and CDG
this year.  St Louis had great growth too (Southwest effect?) and you
can clearly see the entry of Valujet in the Atlanta figures.
Third column is pax in millions, the fourth is growth in percent
The Wall Street Journal reports (April 12, page A2) that of the 20 gates
that CO contracted for before its 1990 bankruptcy, CO was released from
all obligations on 10 gates. This will reduce CO's commitment to DIA from
$59m to $27m, and the other airlines costs per passenger will rise by
between $1 and $1.25 to between 17 and 18 dollars.
Of the remaining 10 gates which CO must rent, CO is free to sub-lease
them. CO will use 3 gates itself for its 20 flights a day. CO's  Denver
code-share partners, Frontier and America West, will be able rent the rest
and to relocate their gates next to CO's.
UA's role in this is also interesting.  According to the Journal, "United
had taken the lead in getting other airlines at DIA to go along with
picking up some of Contienental's costs."
UA has been making a boatload of money at DEN since CO left and was
supporting CO's efforts to get out of its lease.  If CO was forced to rent
those gates it would have been bad for UA.  Either CO would have added new
flights to try and better use its gates (cutting into UA's monopoly) or CO
would have tried to walk away entirely (leavig DIA and UA holding the
bag).  UA apparently preferred to keep CO as a small presence rather than
see either alternative happen.
Separately, in a speech at Northwestern, Sky Magary, President of Shuttle
by United, implied that UA's booming business at Denver has constrained
Shuttle's ability to get airplanes
First of all, I would just like to say how happy I am to find such a
newsgroup like this to exist on the internet...I have always been
fascinated by the airline industry, and hopefully someday to be a part of
it.  In the recent years, I have made several observations about the
airline industry in general, and I would like to receive some comment on
what them, whether they are correct or not;
Well...that's all for now...any comments would be welcomed

I worked for Western Airlines during a time when we were "giving" Hawaii
to people who purchased domestic tickets.  The rumor was that our
breakeven load factor on the Honolulu routes was . . drum roll . . 200%.

There are too many factors, one difference that I have brought up serveral
times in rec.travel.air is the number of cabin crew staff.  United
recently announced that they will have 18 flight attendants on Trans-Pac
services.  This is the first time a U.S. carrier matches Asian airlines
in terms of cabin staff.
Headwinds.  CAL's eastbound TPE-JFK flight (as well as Cathay's HKG-YYZ
flight) is non-stop only during winter when there are favorable tailwinds.
Westbound flights always need a refueling stop.
Lower costs, less competition (especially for China AL and Cathay, both
make a lot of money on their near-duopoly HKG-TPE/KKH routes, as well as
the highly-regulated Japanese services).  In the case of Singapore and
Cathay Pacific, both are also very well-managed (can't say that for
China AL).
But EVA lacks of experiences.  They still need time to mature.
On the contrary, USAir probably is not happy at all about this growth.
There are two basic reasons for BWI's fantastic growth since September
1993.  First is Southwest's entry into and expansion of BWI service.
Second is the growth in traffic by other carriers -- especially USAir --
that are forced to match Southwest's low fares in order to maintain
market share.
I haven't studied the issue, but I suspect that USAir's yield -- revenue
per revenue passenger mile -- has dropped at BWI because of the Southwest
service, relatively limited in scope as it is. Also, Southwest has slowly
expanded the number of markets served out of BWI, and USAir clearly wants
to keep that expansion in check.  For example, Southwest in late February
announced a $39 fare for its nonstop service to Birmingham. USAir's
response was not only to match the fare but to initiate nonstop service
in the BWI-BHM market, where it previously had only connecting service.
PHL is an important part of what has traditionally been USAir's strategy
in the Northeast:  offer high frequency, jet service in business markets.
The goal, of course, is to fill planes with business travelers willing to
pay a premium for same-day or overnight roundtrips.  For many years, USAir
also was able to count on leisure traffic as well because the airline
offered the most service.
Now, USAir is being hit on two fronts.  New carriers like Nations Air at
Philadelphia and (soon) Eastwind Airlines at nearby Trenton, N.J., are
threatening to cut into some of the key business markets.  ValuJet
provides service to PHL from its Atlanta hub, connecting passengers to a
number of other points, especially Flordia. In all these cases, the
problem for USAir likely will be lower fares than it otherwise would have
to offer, not a lack of demand.

While it's a choice route, I have to wonder how eager they really were
for the route, versus wanted United *NOT* to have it.  American seems
to play these games quite often, usually aiming at United.  It reminds
me of the stunts the Southern Pacific Railroad used in the 1800s to
try to maintain their monopoly in California.
Other examples that come to mind are American's sudden interest in the
Philadelpha to London route, when United expressed an interest in it
if they could move the US end to Chicago, and their equally sudden
interest in Miami to London after United got temporary authority to
operate the route.
Of course!  <sigh>
I suspect that's the service I was thinking of.
Given the uproar, it wouldn't surprise me, though I don't recall ever
seeing anything to that effect.
The 767-300(ER) is already used in trans-Pacific service, by Qantas,
and possibly Air New Zealand.  Ok, that's not the North Pacific, but
it's an even longer leg.  United uses the 767-300(ER) for LAX-LHR,
and that's further than LAX-NRT (by only 5 miles, but it's still
further).  They also fly LAX/SFO-CDG with it, which is even further,
and TWA flies the 767 on non-stops between California and Europe.  I
suspect you could come up with plenty of other examples.  Why, then,
would you say it's too small to fly across the Pacific?
American did exceedingly well with their early trans-Atlantic service
by using smaller planes in niche markets, while Pan Am and TWA were
trying to fill 747s on the backbone routes.  I see no reason why they
couldn't exploit the Pacific market using the same strategy.
Can't help with the benefits/employer aspect (although I really haven't
heard of a throng of disgruntled ex-employees :)), but they do have a very
good safety record. They have only had two major incidents in the last 25
years. A DC-8 crashed at Pearson International Airport in 1970 due to
premature spoiler deployment on landing (heavy loss of life). A DC9(?) had
to make an emergency landing at Cincinnatti (1982??) when some moron
decided to smoke in the toilets. The resulting fire killed 30-odd
passengers. Hardly a routine occurrence. Yes, safety is excellent.
They are currently in the middle of a fleet upgrade, replacing the
majority of their short-haul DC9s with Airbus A320s and A319s. They are
also adding 4 Airbus A340s for long-haul operations to the Far East.
They secured partial funding recently for the Airbus purchases via a
consortium of off-shore banking institutions.
In summary, they are doing quite well indeed. Managment changes a couple
of years ago set them on an austerity program which is now paying
dividends. Your friend should do well if he gets on board with them.

=================================================================
I suspect the NW flight is not for sale at any price.  It's interesting
since from NW's point of view that flight is "based" in Tokyo, not
Chicago.  That is to say that Chicago is not a hub for NW, whereas
Tokyo is.  Thus it's important more from the point of view of NW's
Asian customers than for NW's American customers.
Whereas for American, it would be just the opposite.  It would be an
awesome route for American to have, but I can't think of anything they
could give to Northwest in exchange.
Beats the heck out of me.  Do you have an inside track on this info, or
was it in a recent Air Transport World, or similar?
You mean December 1994?  I'd like to hear your guesstimates, spill the beans!
UA's ORD terminal, big as it is, is a zoo, people spilling out of the
bars into the promenades, and so forth.  If I had a choice, I'd connect
at Denver every time if I was flying United.  On the other hand, I have
to think this is a mixed blessing for UA, considering the charges they
have to pay.  Then again (on the third hand, I guess) Denver won't be
as susceptible as ORD to weather.

I have been laid-off from Boeing/777 planning for about a year, but I think
my thoughts/comments are still valid...
The first UAL 777's are model -200's -- the 100's should be about a year
later.
Boeing is trying for early ETOPS operation certification, and are on a very
accelerated testing program to try to convince the FAA that it is
safe..remember Extended Time Ops = Engines Turn Or Passengers Swim...
As of a year ago, the development team for the "New Large Aircraft" hadn't
made up their minds.  A real problem with a full upper deck is evacuation --
can you imagine a 787 with 10 different slides out the doors? Especially if
a gearset has collapsed and the upper doors are 80-90 feet up?  And evac-ing
800 people in a disaster?
As of that year ago, the super-jumbo was a new design, but sorta based
around the 747.  One option was to have the cockpit on the main deck, so you
could say that it resembled a bloated 777.......

	Really?  My family is literally "forced" to take Philippine
	Airlines because United Airline's flights to Manila are
	consistently packed.  Even back in the early 80's, my family
	used to take the PanAm clippers.  This may be true to other
	Asian families, but not mine.  My family will more likely than
	not take an American airline.
	On another note, I myself enjoy UA's service.  I think they're
	the best in the business.  I don't get the "attitude" I get
	from Northwest'f flight attendants, or the "snobby-look" from
	AA.  This is my opinion.  It's just that whenever I fly a non-UA
	flight, I have problems with the staff -- with the exception of
	Delta.
	Yes they can.  747-400 have the longest range of any commercial
	liner.  Correction.  The A340 has a better range.  I'm puzzled
	to why China Airlines had a refeuling stop.  I know 747-400's
	can fly direct from SFO to Tokyo's NRT.
	I think the fact that they are government subsidized has something
	to do with it, but that doesn't explain Air France, does it.
	Also realize that the US Domestic Travel Business is highly
	competitive, so airlines, to stay ahead, will lower their prices
	accordingly, even if it mean takinga minor loss.
	Umm...you weren't flying out of SFO.  I've noticed most of the
	airlines you've mentioned flies out of SFO.  I myself am not
	familiar with Virgin Atlantic.  All I know about them is
	that they fly 747's exclusively.
There is no question about that fact.  RT fares between BWI and SFO
have dropped almost 25% since Southwest entered the market.  And
Southwest isn't even competitive fare-wise in that market (i.e.
Southwest has never been cheaper than the other carriers on this
route).  Indeed, it would appear that Southwest's presence has had a
flattening effect on almost all fares.
... Well, all fares except, for example, BWI-RDU.  As soon as American
pulled out of that market, USAir doubled the round-trip fare.
I've wondered about this move by USAir.  Here's a thought:  USAir's
yields between BWI-PIT, BWI-CLT, and BWI-PHL have traditionally been
very high.  BWI's non-stop service tends to center around Maryland,
Virginia, Florida, the Carribbean, and selected northeast cities.
Almost anything else requires a connection.
If USAir has to charge $39 BWI-CLT-BHM-CLT-BHM, they are losing two
seats BWI-CLT and CLT-BWI ... two seats which they would otherwise sell
to higher fare tickets.  Given that USAir must match Southwest's fare
in the BWI-BHM-BWI market (so that they don't look like total wimps),
could they possibly be losing *less* by putting all of those low-fare
passengers on a non-stop to BHM, on a gamble that the BWI-CLT seats
will generate offsetting revenue?  Am I out to lunch here?

	Is there really any such thing? I have heard the two (variants)
of the 777 referred to only as 'A market' and 'B market', and I
have sometimes heard the B market version referred to as 777-200B (although
not from very reliable sources). If the designations were -100 and -200,
I am sure that that is what AvWeek and the like (and Karl for that matter)
would have been using. Boeing seems to have stopped producing -100 variants
of their new planes. There are no 757-100 or 767-100 types, (Did these exist
in the planning stages?) and in the case of the last two aircraft that did
come in -100 versions (the 737 and 747), these aircraft were rapidly phased
out in favour of the -200. Possibly Boeing has decided that a -100 series
aircraft is like version 1.0 of a software product, and has decided to
solve the problem by not releasing them any more. (This is fine by me,
as long as we don't get Boeing 777-95). Perhaps someone who knows more about
this than I do could comment.
	The 'can you imagine trying to evacuate this many people in a
disaster' argument doesn't hold too much weight with me. This argument
has always come up whenever a substantially larger aircraft came into
being. Procedures have to be adapted to handle it, yes. Once in a while
you are going to get an accident in which 800 people die, yes. But,
if the average risk to a passenger on the new aircraft is the same
(or less) than on smaller aircraft, safety is not being compromised.
Fatalities will occur in larger clumps, yes, but this does not necessarily
indicate a reduction in safety. (I do agree that the height of the
doors in a double deck aircraft could be a ploblem. But it is a solvable
problem.)

                -- Francois Fenelon
   In his presentation at Northwestern on Shuttle by United, Sky Magary
outlined the reasons for the creation of Shuttle and fit with the rest of
the airline. A summary of his points follows.
Historically, 50% of UA's Origin/Destination/Connecting traffic was in the
western US.  UA's western strength was strategically important in
competing with American Airlines which was traditionally strong in the
East.
In 1991 UA had 50% of the local market share in California.  In that same
year, WN entered all of UA's traditional markets except SFO.  By 1994 UA
had abandonned every route which did not attach to a long haul route.  Its
cost per ASM was US$.11 versus $.075 for WN.
UA faced the prospect of losing high-margin long haul markets to AA if it
could not shore up the West coast feeds.
By UA's estimate, only 1/4 of US markets are suited to point-to-point
service (more on the implications of this for WN in another post)  Of
these dense markets, only the ones in the West allowed free entry.  The
dense eastern markets had slot-controlled airports at least one endpoint.
To UA this implies both that California was the right place to offer
point-to-point and that unless slot restrictions are removed, the East
will never be a suitable Shuttle market.
What is a good, dense market?  By UA's estimate, there are 12
point-to-point markets in Califoria which have more than 1000 PDEW
(passengers per day, each way)
UA really agonized over all the operational details of it shuttle [my
note: unlike CO which simply copied WN]
1) UA chose gates close to the runway, not close to the landside, to
minimize taxi time
2) UA changed pilot checkoff procedures, recognizing that a plane that was
on the ground many times a day would have a different maintenance feedback
loop than a plane flown cross country.
3) UA implemented their WILMA boarding procedure (Window, Middle, Aisle).
This had the interesting side effect of balancing demand between window
and aisle seats. SInce they board first, window pax get to hog the
overhead bins, while aisle customers get the traditional easy-in-easy-out
advantage. In operation WILMA allows a 126 passenger 737 to be boarded in
10-13 minutes and in experiments they've been able to board a 195 seat 175
in 15 minutes.  (They have no plans to add 757 to shuttle at this time
4) Keep the travel agents happy. in OAK-LAX (the second biggest O&D market
for WN) UA offers 1/3 of the seats, but gets 50-55% of agency bookings.
5) About 1/3 of UA's premier customers don't like the new shuttle, either
because they had a set commuting pattern or because they don't see the
benefit of lower prices (their business paid). On the other hand 2/3
prefer the lower fares and better frequency of the Shuttle. Magary says
that UA should have done a special mailing to its premiers (rather than an
insert in the FF mailings) which wouldh have explained all of Shuttle's
changes (like how the longer walk to gates close to the runway would save
taxi time)
6) They may experiment with a simpler [and I bet much cheaper] paint
scheme on a few new 737's  it retained the blue striped tail and blue
belly, but had a light fuselage [probably to cut air conditioning and
painting costs] and script Shuttle logo
7) UA is satisfied with the ability of Shuttle to feed pax to the rest of
the UA system--either through frequent flier loyalty or direct
connection.  Shuttle handles $360M worth of pax shared with the rest of
UA's system [the kind of figure that the folks in Finance love, but no one
knows what it means]
8) Shuttle's cost per ASM is now below .08 and they've told the analysts
they expect it to be down to .076 by the end of the year.
9) UA is consciously collecting the "historical premium" from last-minute
travellers which travel from SFO commands. Since folks have been
conditioned to pay more out of SFO, UA sees no reason to cut prices to
compete with SJC or OAK.  At the same time, UA is keeping OAK and SFO
prices more competitive for advance purchases.
10)The California competitors are currently matching prices and flooding
the market with capacity.  As some of that capacity is wrung out by
competition (as UA's was from OAK-ONT), expect to see it redeployed in
markets like SFO-PDX and xxx-PHX or LAS.  However, due to the needs of the
Denver hub (and its profits from traditional service) don't expect to see
much expansion of Shuttle outside of West Coast markets.
   Sky Magary, President of Shuttle by United, in his speech at NU alluded
to the limits on point-to-point service.
   He asserted that only about 1/4 of US markets can support direct
service and most of these are on the West Coast.  Since this implied that
WN was serving many non-point-to-point markets with point-to-point
service, I asked him to explain the discrepancy.
   He believes that at PHX, STL, MCI, and DTW, Souhtwest is dependant on
connecting (or multi-stop) passengers--that is to say most of the people
who are on a plane in these cites are either just passing through or will
be on the flight for more than just the first leg out of the city. The
hubbed airlines have realized this and have begun to match WN's one-stop
service with good connections at comparable prices via their hubs.
   This is one of the unseen sources of pressure on WN's bottom line: all
that service WN added in the midwest and east relies on one-stop and
multi-stop passengers to fill the planes.
   We tend only to see how WN competes in its traditional non-stop markets
(CA and TX).  We tend to focuson WN's high frequencies and low prices on
non-stops because they are few and easy to track and WN tells us they are
a point-to-point airline.
    But the real fight with WN in the east and midwest is in all those
connecting markets where only those with advanced computer systems can
really see how connections can systematically beat one-stops and
multi-stops. Perhaps this is why Northwest went to three daily
omnidirectional banks at its MEM hub--to maximize its ability to put
connecting passengers on flights versus WN's  one-stops.
Note: Air France's cancellation is not official.
That's still a heck of a lot of markets.  Imagine some Southwest style
airline serving all of them.  What does that imply for the traditional
airlines and for the remaining 3/4 of the markets?
Also, at what level of fares?  Southwest levels or United levels?
Traffic is substantially greater at Southwest levels, we all know that.
As WN grows, more connections become possible and so they will clearly
be picking up connecting/one-stop traffic.  But I find it hard to believe
that the traditionals are only now waking up to the fact that they
compete with WN on these routes.
Incidently, how does this mesh (if it does at all) with the following
fact:  In its latest schedule, WN has a plethora (maybe 10 or more) of
one-stops from Chicago Midway to Houston Hobby.  They have to be carrying
enough traffic in the market that they'd benefit from putting on at least a
couple of nonstops.  So why don't they?  (Don't tell me they're afraid
of CO, Kevin, I can't believe that's it(*)).  There are other places where
you figure Southwest would short-circuit onestops with at least one
nonstop.  I don't see what the downside of this would be.
Why does a connection beat a onestop?  A onestop would seem to be better
than a connection---less chance of lost luggage for one thing!  No
running around a terminal, etc.  And WN onestops spend much less time
on the ground than any connection, so you'd figure there is a speed
advantage too.  I've never seen any particular charm in a 40 minute
stay in Memphis airport, lining up to board, all the usual stuff.
(*) CO: the Rodney Dangerfield of the majors.  They can't get no
respect from no-one!
You're right, when I said Trans-Pacific I really meant North Pacific.
With landing slots at a premium at most major East Asian airports, I
seriously doubt the B767 can make much impact in the North Trans-Pac
services.  A few Asian carriers, Delta, and AA use the MD11 across the
Pacific.  The MD11 has hardly change the mode of operation across the
Pacific as the B767 did across the Atlantic.  In fact, Korean Air is
planning to pull out the MD11 and convert them to freighters.  I recall
reading an article recently that the average number of seat per aircraft
among Far Eastern airlines is around 300.  The trend is going up not down.
Hence, the B767 is and will be too small for the North Pacific routes.
I'm sure they are paying attention, but I'm not ready to count either of
them among long-term surviors just yet.
According to this months Air Transport World, Frontier's November load
factor was in the mid 30's.  Granted they are still rather new, but that's
clearly far below breakeven for a 737.  If they keep adding new cities month
after month without making sure that the old ones are profitable, pretty
soon they won't serve any cities.
As for Western Pacific, I'm very, very skeptical about a Colorado Springs
hub.  Airports serving areas with two and three times the customer base that
COS has have failed to support real hubs.  If they are depending on lots of
connecting traffic, they should take a lesson from what happened in Kansas
City, Raleigh, Dayton, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Dulles and several other
places.  WestPac hopes to draw lots of traffic from Denver, but that's much
easier said than done.  There's no real precendence of this ever happening
before.  Some will surely make the drive from Denver to COS, but will it be
anywhere near enough to support an airline hub??  Finally, WestPac's short
list of near-term expansion includes such bustling routes as COS-Omaha and
COS-Oklahoma City.  NOW I know what happened to the genius route planners
that CALite canned.
Lastly a discouraging bit of anecdotal WestPac information.  A close friend
in San Francisco saw a WestPac ad which mentioned some great intorductary
fares on routes which included SFO-COS-Kansas City.  When my friend
*finally* got through to an agent, she said they didn't serve those cities.
My friend mentioned the SFO ad, and she then noted that SFO service was to
begin on 5/8.  Too bad...the ad said the introductary fares were only good
4/30 through 5/7.  Hmmmm...is this yet another start-up airline which is
more concerned about finding young, enthusiastic things that will smile for
$5/hour than, say, uhh, TRAINING?  At a copmany that small the agents should
have the flight times memorized!  I should call myself and quiz them on what
state Colorado Springs is located in.

okay, okay, sorry for the cheap shots
AND
The two main South African gateways...Johannesburg and Cape Town, which are
barely keeping pace with a massive increase in internatioanl travel since the
demise of sanctions.  In Johannesburg chaos is the word.  They built the new
sections but only now are putting in travelators.
from SFO-NRT, or SFO/LAX-TPE with a 744 is no problem.  But I think the
original poster was talking JFK-TPE, which is a lot longer and does require a
scheduled stop in ANC.  TPE-JFK is nonstop if the tail winds are good.
(or do I have that reversed???)
Speaking of TPE-JFK, it has been rumored that CAL will switch to
MD-11s on this flight. Wonder what kinda effect that will have on the
range and the frequency of refueling stops in ANC.
Going back to refueling stops, whether a plane can fly to a particular place
on a given day depends on  the payload and the weather.  If the weather
is good (tail winds) then  the allowable payload is higher.  If the
weather is bad (head winds) then the allowable payload is lower.  The
flight dispatch people calculate  this figure for every flight and this
plus the fuel onboard plus  the dead weight of the airplane cannot exceed
a certain figure called the  maximum takeoff weight, which depends on the
type of aircraft and the  runway it's using.  the parameters have to be
balanced,  and if they're not the flight can't be released.  in cases of bad
weather if the payload you need to carry is so large (full load of
passengers, for example) that you exceed the  allowable payload, then you
have to decrease the fuel onboard to stay in balance, which means
you won't have enough to fly nonstop hence the stop in ANC.
that's a very rough explanation...those of you more familiar with flight
operations please feel free to correct.
I don't think any of these airlines are goverment subsidized.
I think it's the lack of competition in their home countries, except for
CAL (which still made a marginal profit last year, despite the crash at NGO
and increased competition from EVA.)  Plus the fact that these carriers all
are countries with very good economies that lead to increased travel,
both in foreigners needing to go visit these countries and in the
citizens who have more money for airline tickets.  Also, having rights to
lucrative short-haul routes helps (CI and CX the TPE-HKG golden route,
and SQ the SIN-KUL shuttle)  That's where all the profits are, the short
haul routes.
good point.  The airlines above don't have to worry about this.
what makes you think that??? BR has been flying SFO-TPE for over a year now.
nope, they also use Airbus 340's and at least other type (can't remember,
except it's used on their shorter flights)

This is a personal opinion, and not a reflection of my carriers views:
The problem is the mini-deal that goes around the bilateral. Giving UA
exception rights in the ORD-LHR market can be (and is) viewed as
preferential treatment. I believe that UA did have the option of getting
rights to LGW and turned them down. I also agree that if the mini-deal
gives UA access to their largest hub, that AA should get similar access
from DFW, their largest hub, and DL should get access from ATL, their
largest hub.... Both DL and AA are allowed to serve only LGW from ATL and
DFW respectively. UA is not alone in their inability to serve LHR from
their largest hub. In fact, it seems to be the rule with the UK-US bilateral.
Not where have we been, but where have you been? AA fought for six route
authories in 1990, and received one. They were granted the preliminary
approval for ORD-NRT, and then UA played a political card and had the
route awarded to them. Not a bad move on UA's part, but the prelim award
to AA was made in the interest of more competition. By reversing the
route award, the DOT helped to lock competition to UA and NW. DL received
the awards it was seeking in the LAX-NRT and PDX-NRT market, FedEx
received a SFO-NRT award, AA received the SJC-NRT award, HP was awarded
HNL-FUK (yep. not a typo...) and UA received the ORD-NRT award.
Been talked about for years... Don't know if it will work without open
skies, but it has been proposed for over 10 years (pre-Pan Am sale).
With all due respect to UA, TW and NW, the international route authorities
are granted by political appointees, and not neccesarily based on
competition, demand, or the ability of a carrier to serve the route. NW
was able to secure a foothold in the Pacific Rim due to the post-WW2
bilateral that was more or less imposed upon Japan by the US. Pan Am was
able to decide where it flew: getting approval from the respective
governments was a formality. UA was able to retain those rights when they
bought Pan Am's Pacific and LHR operations. TWA was granted most of their
trans-Atlantic route authorities before WW2, and the remainder given as a
way of balancing Pan Am's dominance as a result of their 1950 purchase of
American Overseas from none other than AA. None of these carrier had to
submit any applications or go through a route award process for these
rights.
By allowing UA access to LHR from ORD through a mini-deal, the efforts of
other carriers who have either purchased authorities or gone throught eh
route case process are ignored. The DOT needs to be somewhat responsible
and equitable: the UA mini-deal does not do either.
Good timing on the fleet-size question!  FedEx is the cover story of
this week's AW&ST, and the article just happens to detail the current
fleet operated by FedEx:
Not mentioned in the article -- and not part of the revenue fleet --
are 5 biz jets, a Cessna Citation V plus four Canadair Challengers.
That's a pretty sizeable fleet, but it's still well short of the big
guys.  According to an article in today's WSJ, United had 543 aircraft
in its fleet at the close of 1994.  American's fleet is even bigger,
with 652 aircraft according to Eric Olesen's Airline History WWW page.
British Airways is puny in comparison, with around 250 aircraft.
Note, though, that less than half of the FedEx consists of jets, with
the bulk consisting of the turbo-prop powered F27s and Cessna 208s.
American, United, and British Airways have entirely jet fleets; their
smallest aircraft is the F100 for American and the 737 for United and
British Airways.
Today's Wall St. Journal has an article on page A2 about United's
scaled back fleet expansion plans.  Gerald Greenwald, chairman and
CEO of United, told analysts that the airline now plans a net
addition of 19 aircraft between now and the end of 1997 instead of
a net addition of 48 aircraft under an earlier plan.
The article goes on to note that United's fleet has a relatively
low average age of 10 years, but about 8% of their planes are 25
years old or older.  It also breaks down the 94 aircraft expected
to be retired by the end of 1999:
The most interesting part of the article was reading between the lines.
The above retirement list totals 94 aircraft, which means even if no new
planes arrive between the end of 1997 and 2000, United expects to take
delivery of 113 new aircraft.  However, their current firm orders total
only 58 aircraft -- 24 A320 deliveries are still outstanding from the
firm order for 50, and 34 777s are on firm order.  What might the other
55 aircraft be?
The WSJ article only hints at what else might in the works, saying that
a Boeing spokesman had confirmed talkes about new orders between Boeing
and United.  It doesn't mention the 50 A320 options nor the 34 777
options.  I think there are also additional 747-400 orders and options
still on the books, though that got shuffled around a lot several years
ago when United wanted to cancel some 777 orders.  (I've also heard
that United has expressed interest in picking up several more 747-400s
if they become available with quick deliveries and good prices, like
the two that Northwest cancelled in 1993 and United picked up last
year.)
A more interesting proposition might be an order for more 737s.  United
has already said that they expect Shuttle by United to make money this
year, and despite retrenchments in a few markets they're growing quite
rapidly.  They "only" have a pool of 101 737-300s and around 60 -500s
that must not only support Shuttle flights but, along with the -200s,
all of United's shorter flights.  Don't forget the pending retirement
of the 45 737-222s, so while demand is increasing, supply is going down
to the tune of almost 20% of their 230 aircraft 737 fleet.  If Shuttle
continues to grow, United *must* buy additional small aircraft, and the
737 in some flavor is the obvious choice.
At the other end of the spectrum, the 747-100s supplement the -400s in
the Pacific markets (as the "small" aircraft!) and the 767 fleet on the
heavy routes across the Atlantic (from the east coast -- they don't
have the range to fly California-Europe) and also down to South
America.  777s will probably take over the latter routes, while the
Pacific routes can be handled by additional 747-400s or 747-238Bs freed
from Atlantic routes.  That still leaves all those DC-10 shoes to be
filled, and there simply aren't enough 777s on order to do all of the
work.  Flights that used to rate a DC-10 or 767 from the west coast to
the east coast or Chicago now get a 757 or even an A320, so maybe they
just plan on downsizing these domestic routes, but I wonder how far
they can go with this.
My only conclusion at this point, other than that it will be interesting
to  watch it all unfold, is that it might be a good time to buy Boeing
stock!  :-)
Yep. T-1 is used by HP,US and WN last I knew, and parking positions are
at a premium. It isn't a matter of customer demand at LAX, but real
estate is just not available... Not to mention that ever since the 'ol
"lets divert landing fee revenue into the City general fund" scam a year
or two back, the tenant carriers are less likely to be expanding the
facilities as it will be out of their pockets and not the City's... I
know that AA killed a $10M+- construction project on their facility...
The only relief that might be possible is if HP moves out and WN can
take over their lease in T-1. HP and CO have been working out a recipricol
handling agreement -- HP has been moving to CO facilities east of
Phoenix and CO has been moving to HP facilities west of Houston, with a
few exceptions at major stations... LAX is a major station, but with the
increase in codesharing between the two carriers, I'd be surprised if HP
didn't move into CO's larger facility in T-6 (which I believe is partly
vacant since Morris was absorbed into WN and RenoAir moved into T-4 with
AA...)
While this may be a creative thought, IMHO I don't think airlines generally
schedule flights for the sake of arriving at their destinations at a
convenient time necessarily.  In India for example, all European flights arrive
and depart between around 11pm and 4am.  Indeed, some of the busiest hours at
Bombay and Delhi airports are in the very late hours of the night and wee hours
of the morning.  This happens because the airlines want the flights departing
from Europe to leave at a convenient time (so that connecting passengers can
make the flight without waiting many hours).  Thus, a typical US-India route on
a European carrier might be something like:  Leave Chicago at 5pm, arrive in
Frankfurt at 10am, leave for Bombay at 2pm, and arrive in Bombay at 1am.  There
are exceptions to this.  British Airways' London-Bombay flight leaves Heathrow
at 10pm and gets into Bombay around 7 or 8 the next morning, but this also
means passengers connecting from trans-Atlantic flights have to wait 9-12 hours
in the airport.
I've always been amazed how my aunt in Bombay can put up with picking up
relatives at the airport at 2am every few months or so.
The largest factor is that terminal 2 has customs and terminal 3
doesn't.  NZ and AC aren't going to move to terminal 3 when it would
mean that their international passengers would either have to board
busses or unload in the Bradley terminal.  In fact, I bet Alaska would
love to move into terminal 2 for this same reason.
Another, probably less significant factor is that terminal 2 is quite a
bit nicer than terminal 3.
My mistake. It was Nagoya, not Fukuoka for HP...
(sadly enough, I was in Mohave a few weeks back and saw one of the HP
747-200s that was acquired for the route: it had been cannabalized
already to the point where only the hull and wings were left. No
engines, doors, landing gear, rudder, wing control surfaces, or
windows... I'd assume that it isn't planning to be flown anytime soon!)
T-1 should be all WN.  HP should be moved to T-6 with CO, space providing.  I
was at LAX last month, and T-6 seemed pretty busy (from the runway, albeit),
with a few CO jets and three or four DL jets.  US, in turn, should bemoved to
T-3, and T-2 should be all NW.  One thing that I can't understand iswhy T-2
has HA, NZ, and AC there while NW has to overflow into T-3.  The last time I
flew NW out of LAX, I had to trek over to T-3.  There were four NW planes at
T-3, and another four, maybe five, over at T-2.  Wouldn't it make sense to
move AC, HA, NZ, and US over to T-3, which seems pretty dead besides the NW
activity, and make T-2 all NW?  I know that TW, YX, and Alaska are at T-3, but
TW doesn't have much going on there, YX only one gate (I think), and Alaska is
moderately busy.
Otherwise, there is no other room for expansion at LAX that I know of. T-4 is
all AA, T-5 is all DL, and T's-7 and 8 are all UA.  Bradley, of course, is a
complete zoo.  Things have gotten so bad at LAX that charters and others, such
as Carnaval, Tower, Rich, and ATA leave from Bradley because there is no other
place for them.
BUR has plans to expand.  Maybe some carriers will consider entering BUR after
the expansion is complete as an alternative to the traffic at LAX.

Stephen, we did this in rec.travel.air.
How many major airlines are in Chapter 11 at the moment?  Zero.
So it's not a terribly great effect currently.
It might once again, and it has been in the past, but right now
it's not a direct factor (CO and TW may be getting some advantage
over their creditors by the threat of bankruptcy).
As for fare wars, low fares are not in and of themselves a bad thing.
Of the majors, Southwest has consistently had the lowest fares and
consistently been the most profitable (it's current wobble has only
lowered profits---it's not making a loss yet).  Valujet claims to be
doing spectacularly well, at far lower average fares than Delta.
That said, bankruptcy procedure certainly needs to be revamped in the US.
Well, for starters, the only current Chapter 11 carrier is Mark Air,
which isn't all that big a carrier. A bunch of carriers have used
chapter 11 to restructure. Arguing that the industry would be happier
without those carriers in business is hard to do, as what ifs are always
somewhat a matter of opinion. But, I'd point out that the history of
what happens to domestic carriers as they go belly up is that low
cost carriers spring up in thier markets and the remaning majors
move in on the markets from thier own strongholds. Both of these
activities can lead to farewars.
Fare wars have been waged by both the previous chapter 11 carriers
when they were (and were not) under chapter 11 protection and the
non chapter 11 carriers. The economics of the airline industry are
very nasty. The major carriers found out just how nasty when
deregulation struck. While some did better than others, all hit
pretty rough going.
As long as you have a large number of seats chasing after a smaller
number of customers, and it's better to make some money then no money
from a customer, the airlines will have an incentive to offer fares
right down to the incremental cost to carry the additional body.
The industry, as a whole has been slowly shedding capacity, as the
various players deal with some of the realities of the marketplace. This,
coupled with growth in travel, has given the industry as a whole some
relief. (As has a mjor focus on productivity, better route management,
more efficient scheduling, etc)
All of the efforts to cut capacity and be more efficient won't help
much as long as people can enter cheaply and run at very low margins.
There's no reason to imagine that this won't happen. As you point out,
there are plenty of airplanes to be had cheap. One can imagine the
ongoing scenario of people opening up little low cost carriers, running
thier planes into the ground as they make just enough profit to keep
in business, but not enough to cover the cost of new planes. At the
same time, they lower the profitability of all thier compeitors as well,
keeping it hard for them to replace planes.
Since there's no bar to entry (Unless your last name is Lorenzo)
anyone can do this in any market, and they only have to convince
thier backers they might make enough money to pay off their loans.
Of course, as far as I can tell, every business plan ever offered
to the banks is optimistic (Probably a requirement to start a
business in the first place) The industry is littered with
optimists who didn't realize how hard it is to make money and how
easy it is to lose money.
I don't think that you can blame Chapter 11 for all the industry's
ills. Stupidity, greed, pride, and people who spent 40 years in a
cozy, regulated industry trying to deal with a free market with
totally new dynamics all have a place when it comes to blame.
In reading over the recent spate of articles, it seems that with CO
drifting out of DEN, UA can keep fares up and really profit.  Pitty
Coloradoans!  Does DEN  have anyone offering lower-than-UA fares?
While flying to PHX->STL->BWI and back recently, the STL->PHX leg
was pretty low on pax, so I had opportunity to chat about this-n-that
with one of the FAs.  I asked what she knew about WN's perspective of
DEN, and she indicated it cost WN $38/pax to land at DEN (new DIA).
If true, that would make it difficult for an low-fare airline to use DEN.
Is this cost correct?
Good question.  Here's my guess:
Or it simply could have been that the Dayton-Greensboro route just looked
too, too tempting.
Sorry for the sarcasm.  If it weren't for such eccentric decisions the
industry would get pretty boring sometimes.  I should thank them.
Last I heard, CO was flying the Denver-London route once per week.  AA has
to like that.  American has the best routes to London for a huge chunk of
the west and southwest with grips on both the Dallas and Chicago gateways.
There are alternatives via STL on TWA and to a lesser extent MSP on NW, but
really AA is in a strong position without a London competitor at Denver,
Dallas, O'Hare or Salt Lake City.
Btw, Delta's protests on not getting Salt Lake-London were recently blown
off again.  American gets to keep Raleigh-London and Nashville-London even
though both of those hubs are virtually dead, but that 40% chunk of the US
between LA, Dallas, MSP and Seattle gets a single weekly nonstop to London
from a non-hub airline in Denver.
Hmmmmm.

What I have read in the Denver papers: 1. Continental was using the route
for negotiating leverage with the city of Denver. They have renegotiated their
DIA lease, but nothing was ever mentioned about the london route when the new
deal was announced.
2. What CO really will do is move the route to Phoenix, where they can tie-in
with HP. 3. United would only want the route if they could fly to Heathrow in-
stead of Gatwick. (Sounds nutty to me. With this mega-hub they have created at
DEN, UA should still make a go of it at Gatwick)

I would note that Cleveland (in the persons of the airport & economic
development folks) has been begging CO for CLE-LGW for a long time.  If CO
were allowed to move DEN-LGW to some other city it seems like a fairly
even match between:
1) Going with its own hub at CLE, even though there is already
considerable competition from the eastern US to London.
2) Going with HP at PHX, a market in a region hungrier for LON service,
but at an airport where the connecting $$ will go to HP.
AS would definitely have to include SEA as a hub of some sort.
Upgrade CVG to a Whopper Hub.  DL and OH (Comair/Delta Connection) are the
two largest airlines at CVG; DL's operations there are now larger than
either their DFW or SLC hubs.  CVG is even closing in on ATL in some ways,
with the expansion DL and OH have done.  (OH has their own 50+ gate
concourse, complete with a duty-free kiosk for their CRJ flights to
Canada.)  DL ads are now touting CVG as the "O'Hare Bypass", with better
weather, easier connections, and so forth.  (Interesting similarities here
to Western's old ads touting SLC as a better alternative to DEN, before
the merger.)
SLC is also gaining flights, mostly on SkyWest, another Delta Connection
carrier; both ComAir and SkyWest are flying larger and larger CRJ fleets,
picking up "thin" city routes from the hubs at SLC, CVG, and MCO (which is
getting several of Comair's CRJs).  The SkyWest concourse at SLC was also
recently expanded and renovated; though it's quite a bit smaller than OH's
Concourse C at CVG, it still has room for 16 or so gates.
MCO is a minor hub not just from WDW traffic, but also because of the
substantial (and growing) Comair presence there.
BOS should probably be added as a Vestigial Hub; DL does have a fairly
solid presence here, including one of the two Business Express (Delta
Connection *and* Northwest Airlink, now) hubs (JFK is the other) as well
as code-shared flights on SN to Brussels and VS to London-Gatwick.
Add PDX and LAX to the Vestigial Hubs list for their role in gatewaying
Pacific Rim traffic (and the SkyWest hub at LAX, for those of you who just
*love* EM2s).  They're probably at about the same level as JFK.
I'd add BOS as a "bygone" Vestigial Hub, and add SEA which still had a
fairly hefty presence last I checked.  MEM probably could go to Minor Hub.
Other "bygones" could include MKE... I never did figure out why they were
trying to add another hub in the northern tier.
BOS probably qualifies as at least a vestigial hub for US, who at times
seem to have made a vestigial hub out of every city in the northeast US
with a sizable airport.  (They're reportedly the passenger carrier with
the most flights per day from BOS.)
Here's my attempt at a chart.  Division into categories is based on an
arbitrary weighting based on number of flights, city dominance, number of
passengers and a rough sense of how profitable the hub is and what I ate
for dinner tonight.
The line between Minor Hubs and Vestigial Hubs gets kind of blurry.  Any
corrections or amendments (like for Alaska and international airlines)
would be welcome.

Monday's (4/17) Minneapolis Star Tribune business section contained a
typically content free (for the paper) story about Northwest Airlines,
the wage concessions, and how wonderful everything is. It did contain
an interesting graph showing costs per ASM for several airlines. Even
with the concessions, NW was near the highest at about 9.5 cents per
ASM, second only to USAir. For all airlines, costs were fairly similar
between 1993 and 1994. There were some brief footnotes, one of which
stated that NW's costs included "restructuring and ESOP costs". So
maybe these numbers are more indicative of where the cash costs will
when the wages snap back next year. A table is included below.
Assuming that this data is reasonably accurate, it would seem that the
recent record profits must be coming more from the revenue side than
the cost side.  Healthy revenue are likely due to
While NW has done quite well over the last year or so, it isn't
obvious that this financial performance will be easy to maintain.  I
would think that there is a lot more downside risk than upside
potential here. The US economy may very well slow down, other airlines
should soon enjoy arrangements like the NW-KLM partnership as additional
open skies treaties are negotiated between the US and European
countries, and competition seems inevitable. (As long as NW wants
$1200+ for a MSP-LAX roundtrip I would think that this market would be
attractive. On a trip last week, our corporate travel agent got us a
$700 fare on America West; maybe this is a beginning.)

Costs in cents per available seat mile (asm) for 1994. 1993 numbers
were very similar.
Taken from a bar graph, so these are to the nearest half-cent.
Why do some people prefer JFK over EWR?  It's all about prestige.  Gatwick
started life as almost a completely charter based airport.  It's now got
a respectable amount of scheduled traffic, but it still suffers the old
stigma.  In terms of airline connections, it is nowhere near as well
served as Heathrow, tending to be filled by second tier airlines.  There
are two terminals.  North (Just British Airways I think), and South
(everyone else).  The South terminal has the direct connection to the
trains, the north is connected to the South terminal by a people mover.
As an airport, I like it.  You are right, the public transportation to
London is probably superior (depending on exactly where you want to go).
The British rail station is connected with the airport, and there are direct
services to many parts of central London.
I have had differing levels of service at Gatwick, from excellent, to total
shambles.  The last was thanks to those wonderful people at TWA, who made
a total mess of filling up a 747.
My main reservations about the place is the single relatively short runway.
That same TWA flight, we only left the ground at the very very end of the
runway.  Almost enough to make me give up on my window seat preference.
Now that is a real question.  There is the matter of cab fare being
cheaper to JFK (because of EWR being in another state) but other than
that it's hard to think of any reason to pick JFK over EWR.
I have heard that there are ATC problems at EWR, but that sounds like
a fixable problem, and the lineup to depart from JFK in the evenings
is unbelievably awful.  Traffic is a disaster, JFK is a dump, the
list of peeves goes on and on.
I just don't see the prestige.  SAS abandoned JFK years ago, and
apparently made a lot more money at EWR through their agreement
with CO.
Every year you see EWR sneaking up on JFK in the airport rankings.
The growth rate of EWR is faster, so I bet by the year 2000 we see
EWR as the largest NYC area airport.
One thing I don't understand:  EWR is building a larger international
area in Terminal B.  Why don't they build it off the third unused
"stub" pier of Terminal C?
JFK is without a doubt the most insanely crappy airport in the United
States and possibly in the entire First World.  Every time I go through
there I am simply amazed at the complete shoddiness of the entire
operation, and the totally bungled "JFK 2000" project (now on hold
until 3000) has only added to the frustration and confusion of the
place.  Even some things which could be remedied without any hassle
whatsoever are left unattended -- for example, in the UA terminal,
why does the bar not take credit cards?  And I do not mean -- it
does not take my favorite credit card, it just doesn't take them
period.
So now to the question:  why do people prefer it?  I wondered about this
repeatedly during the ten years that I lived in the New York area, and
finally came up with four reasons:
* prestige from the past.  Crazy as it may seem, to many middle- and late-
middle-aged New Yorkers, international travel still means departing from
"Idlewild".  There is a nostalgic romance in their minds which the present
condition of the airport apparently does not shatter.  Add to this what
for many New Yorkers remains the "stigma" of New Jersey and these folks
will continue to choose JFK for international departures.
* force of habit.  Believe it or not, it took many New Yorkers years to
realize that a build-up of international service had taken place at
EWR.  As a friend from northern New Jersey once commented, "Newark was
our little secret for years and years".  Once word began to get out,
many people took a long time to change their patterns.
* orneriness.  Complaining about JFK is a full-time occupation for many
well-traveled New Yorkers.  EWR is simply too easy to use for the cranky
New York soul.
* and finally a more "objective" reason.  A lot of the pax at JFK are not
coming from Manhattan (and therefore relatively equidistant from EWR and
JFK) but rather from Long Island.  JFK is their closest international
gateway (Islip has increasing domestic service but that's all).  Getting
from Long Island to New Jersey is a colossal hassle and for anyone living
in Nassau and certainly Suffolk counties, is not really a viable option.
There's a couple million people right there "captive" to JFK.
To think that Angelenos complain about LAX...
There are two reasons for this that I can think of.  If I'm not
mistaken, the pier at the far end of Terminal C that had been unused
for a long time is no longer idle.  I believe Air Canada and its
commuter affiliates are now using it, and it wouldn't surprise me if
America West is there, too.  The other reason is that the customs
facilities are all in Terminal B already.
This is just my speculation, so there may be other reasons or the
reasons that I've given might be wrong.  I haven't read any official
reason justifying the decision to expand Terminal B instead of adding
international capacity elsewhere.

   While most of JFK may be an old, outdated dump, the original poster said
he was flying AA. American has their own building at JFK with their own
customs, and it's not really bad at all.
   Maybe the way things are right now EWR will catch JFK by 2000, but JFK
has a couple of billion (yes billion) dollars of renovations and additions
coming to it that should be completed by early in the next century.
Several foreign airlines will be building a new terminal where the old
Eastern one is. I believe they are Lufthansa, Air France, Korea Air and
some others. Also the worst part of the airport, the international wing
will be redone. Also a monorail costing over a billion dollars will be
built from Manhattan to JFK. (The monorail is running into some political
problems now)
Mayor LaGuardia once made a big fuss when landing at EWR when holding
a ticket marked "New York"... and was the force behind the building of
both LaGuardia and Idlewild (now JFK) airports on landfill (LGA's is
supposed to be settling noticeably... not sure about JFK's).

If you just want to fly from the US to London or the South East of England
then from the passengers standpoint flying from Gatwick is generally a
pleasurable and logical choice to make. Gatwick is a major international
airport but has less than half the passengers of Heathrow which probably
gives it a reputation for being a bit more user friendly. Connections to
Central London are quick and easy from whichever terminal you arrive at
using the Gatwick Express rail service.
>From the major international scheduled airline's point of view they're
going to want to use Heathrow every time. Heathrow captures more of the
business market and hence yields are higher. Heathrow historically and to
the presnt day has been a magnet for passengers and so you are more likely
to put a greater number of bums on seats out of Heathrow than Gatwick. In
terms of onward connections, Heathrow has a clear advantage over Gatwick
and this probabaly gives it it's greatest appeal to the international
passenger. BA obviously uses Heathrow as its major hub, but all operators
can utilize Heathrow's hubbing synergy through code-sharing, alliances,
etc..

   While I'm sure that SYD *et alia* are very nice cities, at about 120
yen (my guess for when CO dropped the Anglo Pacific) to the dollar, there
must not have been enough Japanese wanting to go there that CO should have
been in (or reassigned its authority to) SYD-GUM.
   With each drop of the dollar from about 120 yen I'm sure that anything
from GUM looks better and better but the ANZUS business still looks lame.
   As of 4/16 CO will start GUM-SYD at three roundtrips a week. Why throw
planes at LAX-SYD and get lousy old dollars when you can add service
GUM-SYD and get yen instead?
   Incidentally CO has parked virtually all its 747 and A300 as of March
1. CO is basically an all DC10 airline at the top until the 767 arrives in
1996 and the DC10 fleet is stretched pretty thin covering EWR-ORY,
EWR-LAX-HNL and wherever else the 747 used to go (with the 757 taking old
A300/DC10 routes and a few A300 left doing LAX,PBI,&SJU from EWR).  The
only 747 I see in the schedule does the daily NRT-HNL which probably takes
2 planes.
   Do you really think there's good money to be made YVR/YYZ-LAX-SYD/AKL?
You'll have to excuse me.  When I think of the Pacific I think naturally
of NZ and Australia, since that's where my parents are from.  So when
I say CO pulling out of the Pacific, I am thinking of those markets.
I think there is good money to be made in LAX-AKL/SYD, yes.  QF, NZ and
UA are having a ball on those routes.  There is less competition there
than there has been in many a year.  Air NZ just took a 4th and 5th
747-400 to accomodate demand.
What was lacking for CO was a long-legged jet, which AC has.  AC has
a small fleet of 747-400.
The point is that service by an American carrier to the South Pacific
is greatly enhanced if its feed is backed up by a guaranteed feed
from Canada.  Thus CO or HP service to the S.Pacific gets code-shared
with AC and you have CO/HP flight numbers going e.g. EWR-LAX-SYD/AKL
etc, and AC flight numbers going YVR-LAX-SYD/AKL for example.  No,
YYZ-LAX-SYD/AKL isn't viable by itself, of course not.  But it's
gravy on top of US traffic, of which there would be much.

   Incidentally CO has parked virtually all its 747 and A300 as of March
1. CO is basically an all DC10 airline at the top until the 767 arrives in
1996 and the DC10 fleet is stretched pretty thin covering EWR-ORY,
EWR-LAX-HNL and wherever else the 747 used to go (with the 757 taking old
A300/DC10 routes and a few A300 left doing LAX,PBI,&SJU from EWR).  The
only 747 I see in the schedule does the daily NRT-HNL which probably takes
2 planes.
   Do you really think there's good money to be made YVR/YYZ-LAX-SYD/AKL?
There are a number of factors that can cause a scheduled non-stop to have to
make a fuel stop. Winds are one as other have pointed out. Higher than normal
head winds can cause a planned stop (i.e. they know there will be a stop before
departure) and higher than forecast head winds (or lower than forecast
tailwinds) can cause a unplanned fuel stop when you realize that you don't have
enough to make it all the way (most of the very long flights have to trade-off
fuel vs. payload due to wieght limitations - therefore, you don't carry full
fuel if you don't expect to need it).
Another factor is destination weather and how close suitable alternates are. If
the weather at the destination is forecast to be bad and your alternate is two
hours away, then you may have to make a fuel stop to insure that you have the
needed fuel to go to your alternate if required.
Other factors can be conditions at your departure airport. Closure of the
"long" runway can limit you max. take-off weight as can runway surface
conditions (e.g. slush or snow) and winds.
Newsweek has just published a special report on air travel safety in the
United States, in the wake of a year in which more there more fatalities than
in the previous four years combined.
In the article, Newsweek detailed what it thinks are the major problems that
threaten safe air travel in the U.S.  Allow me to summarize:
The article goes on to elaborate on each of these issues, supported by
citations of disasters and the input of industry insiders.
The section concludes with a list of ten ways in which the air travel industry
can be made safer.  Those are:
Another part of the article that caught my eye was Newsweek's own statistical
ratings of the airlines, as far as safety is concerned.  Based on data from
the last ten years, the rankings are as follows, with death risk:
I compared these figures to the study presented in Newsweek's issue dated
September 19, 1994, based on a twenty year test period.
Numbers were also presented for a limited number of international carriers,
with Air Canada, Quantas, El Al, British Airways, and Japan Air Lines being
the safest.
I found the article to be quite interesting, but would have like to have seen
the charts contain more information (i.e., more carriers).  I also found the
descriptions of wind shear and icing to be particularly good, supported by
excellent graphics.
One problem that I had was seeing NW's low rating on both lists.  I can't
remember a NW accident in the last five years.  In fact, the only one I
remember is the DC-10 that crashed near DTW several years ago.  I have to be
missing some, especially if their rating is so close to that of USAir's, for
whom I can name at least six accidents off the top of my head.
All in all, I recommend the article to everyone who reads this newsgroup and
anyone else who flies, not to intimidate them, but rather to inform them as
to the state of air travel safety in the United States.  While the article may
not be totally objective or scientific, it will give you something to think
about.
I'm sorry about the length of this post.  I hope that it was found to be
informative.
Happy, and above all, safe, flying to all.

There are really five fleets -- the two flavors of -200B are quite
different, and there are two -400 configs.
Within the *four* (or five) fleets, the aircraft are pretty much
interchangeable.
Yes.  Most have been upgraded to 750,000 lbs MGTOW though the last
data I saw said a few still were at 734,000 lbs.  This doesn't have
any correlation to -122 or -123; they're probably being upgraded at
their next D check.  The weight limit of some only seems to restrict
payload and not routes.
The -123s have the old three-window upper deck with a 19' upper cabin
instead of 25', which eliminates the upper galley and makes the cabin
a bit less comfortable, but otherwise the -122s and -123s of the same
weight are identical.
The -222Bs and -238Bs are very different aircraft.  The -222Bs are
amongst the last 1st generation 747s built, and at 833,000 lbs MGTOW,
they're actually capable of higher weights than an Air France -400!
They are configured with a very premium mix of seats (35/134/124) and
generally stay on the JFK-NRT routes they were purchased for or switch
over the EWR-NRT depending on loads.  The only other route I've ever
seen one fly is EWR-SFO, presumably for maintenance.
The seven ex-Qantas -238Bs are, in contrast, fairly early examples, 12
years older than the two -222Bs, and even after several upgrade rounds
are only good for 800,000 lbs MGTOW.  They have a more conventional
seating config as well (18/79/272).  Originally, they flew European
routes while the -100s flew Hawaii and the Pacific, but the -238Bs
have since been reconfigured and now the -100s and -238Bs fly pretty
much the same routes, except for SFO-LHR (and LAX-LHR, when it gets a
747) which a -100 doesn't have the range to handle.  They aren't fully
interchangeable because the -238Bs have a different seating config,
due to their main galley being on the main deck instead of below as on
the -100s.  (The first three -238Bs are slightly different from the
latter four, too, primarily in the setup of the upper deck galley, but
this doesn't seem to be a significant operational difference.)
The -451s are essentially the same as all but the first six -422s.
The first six have more premium seats than the others (36/123/142
vs 18/80/320).  From what I've heard (and observed), the ORD-NRT
flights always rate one of these six, while the four not working
that route are assigned to various routes based on demand.
Yesterday in our local newspaper, American Eagle announced that they
were ending all service to Nashville from Willard Airport
(CMI)... leaving us with no flights at all toward the southeast (and
leaving my boss, who flew frequently to DCA on business, and got much
better service via Nashville, irritated).
Though I've seen statements from AA that they were winding down their
Nashville hub, I hadn't seen any announcement stating flat-out that
they were ending all commuter service to there at a certain
date... has anyone seen such an announcement?
If memory serves me correctly, CMI's remaining flights (all turboprops
or prop service) go to ORD (I don't think MDW anymore), STL, DTW, MSP
and IND (which may not last long if USAir is dehubbing there).
Customs faciliies exist in the Term-C stub already... in fact this part
of the terminal was open two or three years before the rest of the
terminal was -- PE operated their LGW & BRU flights from there back in
1986; the terminal didn't open until late '87 / early '88. I believe that
only CO and SK are using these facilities at the moment (AC flights
arrive and depart as domestic from the US..)
Given the international traffic growth and the fact that the other carriers
now operate from Term A and B, the decision was made to expand Term-B and
meet the expansion needs of those tenant airlines versus expanding what
is already a newer facility.
My, my, my... Trying to compare a brand new airport and a new terminal is
quite the apples and oranges analogy to me... PE staff did get to see the
inside once the building shell was up, but the passengers never did!
While it is true that the increase in lease costs that PE was to
experience in Term C was more than what they were paying for with the
North Term, it was also fixing a major image problem for the carrier in
terms of being a non-modern airline who still had an entirely outdoor
hub operation in the mid 80's. The hope was that by going to the new
terminal, the hub would work more effectively from a service standpoint.
I can only assume that people are more willing to fly on an airline using
jetways with reasonable gate seating areas versus a carrier who used an
older facility with inadequate seating areas, poor heating/air
conditioning, and a bunch of rolling stairways.. Have you ever walked up
the stairs to a 747 with all of your carryons?. Not a pretty site in
the rain or in the middle of winter....
I don't have specifics on the construction cost, but most of the physical
plant construction was financed by the Port from what I remember: PE was
only locked into the long term lease and not really liable for more than
the jetways, bagbelt systems and other interior furnishings for space
occupied by PE. In general, the Port provides the basics i.e. lighting,
walls, floor coverings in the public areas and concourse halls,
heating and air conditioning. The carrier provides the rest i.e. gate
holdroom carpeting, ticket counters, etc....
In this regard, the costs are the same at DIA as they were for PE/CO at
EWR. The major difference is that for PE, there was no increase in landing
fees or general cost of doing business increases. They retained the same
maintenance and catering facilities, as well as the proximity to their
training facilities and general offices. They were able to maintain the
same contracts for hotels, fuel, etc... This is not the case at DIA,
where the investment in a maintenance facility for most carriers was
written off. The proximity and convenience that UA had for their crew
training facility and their data center is now lost. Many of the
negotiated hotel contracts for crews had to be cancelled in favor of
hotels closer to DIA (which are few at the moment...). Fuel, catering and
other service contract costs will be higher as the contractors now have to
recoup -their- increased costs... So that is a much higher cost increase
than what PE would have seen at EWR...
The recent thread regarding the size and classification of airline hubs in
the US inspired (?) me to evaluate all US hubs and rank them in terms of
capacity.  To obtain my information I counted each departing flight operated
by the major airline (and code-sharing regional) at 43 different airline hub
operations.  By multiplying the number of each aircraft type by the its
seating capacity I arrived at a total number of daily departing seats
(weekday).  I used the May 1995 North American OAG (both pocket and desktop
versions), plus airline timetables to fill in a few international gaps.
The definition of what is and isn't a hub gets blurry around the margins.  I
chose to exclude airports like Boston, La Guardia and LAX because I see them
as much more of a concentration of flights than a real hub.  The so-called
hubs of Delta at JFK and United at Dulles are virtually nothing but some
weak, once-a-day feed for a set of international flights.  TWA at JFK,
however, has multiple flights to several destintions which exist independent
of international connection, so I included TWA/JFK.  Another judgement call.
And despite claims to the contrary, several big Southwest airports are de
facto hubs, so there are included.  If anyone really wants to know why I did
or didn't include a particular airport among my hubs, write me directly.
Total Brand = Total offered under the brand of the major airline, including
code-sharing regional airlines.  Does not include code-sharing with other
major airlines (such as CO/HP) or with international partners.

Again the National Institute for Aviation Research has churned out their
annual ranking of Airline Quality.  And unless they've made some serious
changes in their methods (and from what I've heard so far they have not),
their results are pretty much meaningless.
I've complained about this ranking before, but recently I came upon the July
1994 issue of "Consumer Reports Travel Letter" which points out the many
flaws of this much-hyped "ranking" quite well.  I'll draw from their
words as well as my own thoughts for this posting.
Three semi-reasonable factors used in the Airline Quality Ratings:
*Lost Baggage:  Makes sense to me
*Bumping:  They only consider *involuntary* bumping, not total denied
boardings due to overbooking.  One of the biggest total-bumpers (AA) is also
one of the best at coaxing people to volunteer, and thus ranks very well.
*On-time performance:  This statistic is so manipulated that it is only
marginally related to what "on-time" is commonly perceived as.
The AQR includes complaints per 10,000 passengers in their survey, but
counts this as not one but *eight* separate factors ("flight problems",
"fares", "customer service", "refunds", "advertising", "credit", "refunds"
and "other").  By counting this one factor as eight, it makes up almost half
of the entire set of scoring elements.  Complaints are important, but this
is much overstated.
The AQR has three factors which are surrogates for "safety".  But there is
absolutely positively no reasonably valid way to include the factor of
safety among the major airlines.  Despite what the fools at Newsweek (who
have demonstrated a clear knowledge of 8th grade algebra with their
statistical evaluations) there is no significant difference between the
major airlines in terms of safety.  This has no business in a quality survey
of any credibility.
The AQR includes three factors that have zippo corelation with "quality":
*Financial Stability, and
*Cost per Seat Mile:  I suppose they wanted some way of proving that
financially-troubled airlines are "bad".  But ask youself...has AA's Quality
imporved versus 1992 when they were losing money hand over fist?  Is DL's
quality *improving* as they continue to cut ASM costs?  Duh.
*Fleet Size:  This is laughable.  Nothing makes an airline with a bigger
fleet have a higher quality serive.  A stronger arguement could be made that
bigger is *worse*, although I think it is a meaningless factor.
Lastly, they ignore what Consumer Reports Travel Letter considers very
important tie-breakers:
*Comfort:  No consideration is made regarding seat size, pitch or
configuration that airlines offer.  By the AQR system, there is no scoring
difference between a 737 coach seat and a 747 sleeper seat.  Somehow I think
there is a quality difference they've missed here.
*Food:  Food service is typically low among reasons for chosing a specific
airline, ranking below price, schedule and frequent flyer considerations.
Yet when reporting on "quality", the quality and availability of food
service is viewed as important.  In other words, most will fly Airline X if
the schedule, fare or FF miles are right, food or not.  "Quality" does not
lead them to chose one line over another.  Yet replace the meal with peanuts
and customers will scream.
The misguided AQR ranks the majors in this order:
AA, WN, UA, DL, US, NW, HP, TW, CO
Comsumer Reports Travel Letter divised a similar rating system based on
seven factors.  Each line was given a score of 0 to 10 (ten is best) in all
seven categories using 1993 data.  Here are their results:
I'd like to see them update their rankings, as there have been significant
changed is frequent flyer programs since 1993, as well as some shuffling
around in the on-time and complaint records.
On the subject of CO DEN-LGW.  The route is alive for the time being,
although not for long, as you will notice that it is an aircraft and crew
scheduling nightmare; the aircraft must be ferried in and out of DEN.
This is a route that SHOULD have been enormously successful for CO.
London is Denver's largest international destination, and from a
convenience standpoint, virtually all London traffic should have preferred
CO34 to any other carrier's connect service.  Additionally, CO SHOULD have
been able to sell out their superior BusinessFirst seats on the route
daily.  Any executive bound for London would have been crazy to fly in
conventional J class via ORD or DFW just to support his mileage account.
The biggest problem with the route was CO's failure to market it.  Very
few people in the Denver area even knew about the service.  CO had a sales
staff of 8 for the entire region (I assume that UA had in excess of 50)
and therefore was unable to get the word out to the community's travel
agents.  Typically, the flight was filled with group traffic...very low
yield.  I doubt that the flight will last beyond the summer schedule, and,
I disagree with Robert Gordon; look for United to want it LHR or not.
None taken and as a general rule I'm somewhat suspicious of anybody who
slices and dices statistics to suit their purposes as well.
Having said that, however, I think in this case there is some validity in
comparing ourselves against the other network carriers (our claim is based
on the DOT stats reported for the seven largest airlines - American,
Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA, United and USAir) and for excluding HP
and WN.  WN is a different type of beast and HP is dramatically smaller.
The DOT definition of a "major" carrier, I believe, is revenues over $1
billion, which does not address the different products of the airlines in
that category.

1.  Europe.  UA has 21 transatlantic flights to Europe this summer.  Three
orig in SFO, two to LHR and one to CDG.  Three to same places from LAX.  That
leaves 15 that originate in ORD, JFK, EWR, and (mainly) IAD.  A few of these
flights have SFO or LAX "tags" (same flight number but different aircraft).
2.  Latin America.  There are six daily flights to "deep" Latin America, that
is, Brazil, Argentina, Chile.  Five operate in 767-300 and one in 747-100.
Two leave from JFK and four from MIA.  Of these, three or four have "tags" to
SFO or LAX, some in the same 767-300s and some in other aircraft.  There are
also 733 tags from MIA to DCA, EWR, and LGA; 763 to ORD.
Today  at 2345 UTC I manage to catch N773UA , a B777,  flight UA9431,  on
a test flight from IAD to HNL.  The flight appeared  routine with one
exception.  Instead of flying the usual R464 Bitta they flew R463 Apack
with something very special.  They request  a 90 degree right turn at
ADENI with a planned decent to 10,000 feet  and requested direct HNL at
10.0  They did not give the reason for this, but since these are test
flights and the aircraft is not ETOP's certified yet, well, you guess.
When do you think any airline would possibly fly a 744 into SAN?  I can't see
the market ever opening up.  SAN passengers will always have to first fly to
LAX if they want to go international.
I don't have any figures, but SAN probably isn't in the 30 busiest airports in
the country.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see SNA or ONT have higher
rankings.  So, yes, I agree that SAN is a "sorry excuse" for an airport
especially given the size of the city.
Yeah - wasn't there some talk years ago about moving the airport to one of the
military bases in the area?  I thought that this would have been a good move.
The runways, some facilities already there, just building terminals and
roads..could have been done by the of the century.  Too late now.
BTW, I do love the location of SAN.  Last time I was in SAN, stayed at the
Hyatt and could see all the planes takeoff/land from my room.

Or, when CDG does become a connecting megalopolis it will be as a rail hub
and therefore possible for anyone, not just AF, to feed connecting
passengers from the Benelux, Switzerland and Western Germany via TGV (the
train, not an airport) to CDG.
So the French, in choosing a land-based strategy to make Paris the center
of Europe, have sort of undermined AF's position.
Is there any announced plan to have the TGVs hub at CDG for the benefit of
making connections with airlines?  Here again AF has problems because the
TGV competes within France with Air Inter and ORY--so on another level,
they'd rather their customers take the Air France bus from CDG to ORY to
make connections than to take the train from CDG.
I don't think that the either the SCNF or AF folks have thought this one
through.
    If fliers think that air travel is becoming more like a trip by bus, I
guess that assessment may be strengthened when new carrier Western Pacific
Airlines launches their flying billboards.
    Western Pacific, which will fly to points in the Southwest U.S. from its
hub in Colorado Springs, is scheduled to begin service Friday (April 28),
according to a report in the April 24 edition of Aviation Week & Space
Technology. And in an attempt to subsidize its "low" fares, the airline has
instituted an "Air Logo" program in which it will sell space for advertise-
ments on the exterior of its Boeing 737-300 jets.
    The first company to sign up for the "Air Logo" program is The Broadmoor
Hotel, a 5-star resort in Colorado Springs. Aviation Week includes a photo of
a Western Pacific jet wearing The Broadmoor's "advertisement." At best, the
plane could be said to resemble a corporate jet; at worst, it brings to mind
the city buses that are "wrapped" in a colorful message for the local zoo,
newspaper or sports team.
    The center of the fuselage is dominated by the words "The Broadmoor/
Colorado Springs" in letters that are almost three times the size of the
letters most airlines use to identify themselves on their planes. The hotel's
slogan, "European Grandeur in the Colorado Rockies," covers the rear of the
fuselage in slightly smaller letters, and the hotel's emblem -- a stylized
"B" surrounded by 5 stars -- fills the tailfin. The stylized "B" has also been
painted on the 737's engines. Squeezed onto the front of the fuselage are the
letters "WP" and the words "Western Pacific."
    Tom DeNardin, Western Pacific's vice president of sales and marketing,
told the magazine, "We have the power to expose a corporation to an enormous
middle-income and high-income audience at a minimal cost-per-thousand."
American Express and the Adolph Coors Co. are also considering buying space
on WP's jets, according to the report.
    I'm surprised that Frank Lorenzo hadn't thought of this when he was
trying to squeeze every cent out of Eastern and Continental. The flying
billboard concept may become popular with beleagured carriers, but I think it
has two major obstacles to overcome before it's adapted by other airlines.
    First, the concept actually would have made more sense when jetways
weren't so common at airport gates. Today, commuter fliers are actually the
only passengers who get a good look at their plane as they board it. At many
airports signs at the gates and jetway corridors, as well as the seating
arrangement in the waiting areas, make it difficult for those inside the
airport to view the planes at the gates.
    Second, even though flying is safer than driving to the local Food Lion,
crashes do occur. USAir has enough of a PR problem when its logo is
prominently displayed amid twisted plane wreckage in photos accompanying
coverage of a major crash, so a company like Coors probably wouldn't want to
renew its "Air Logo" contract if its trademark became associated in the
public's mind with a highly publicized air disaster.
The following is a revised edition of the hub rankings I posted eariler this
week.  See original for additional explanation and disclaimers.
<2 revisions:  WN at LAS was omitted.  Also the hub at SEA is AS, not AA.>
Rank of Domestic US Airline Hubs by Total Weekday Seat Capacity 5/95
Total Brand = Total offered under the brand of the major airline, including
code-sharing regional airlines.  Does not include code-sharing with other
major airlines (such as CO/HP) or with international partners.
Key to less-obvious abbreviations and codes:
I'd be inclined to say that profitability and customer satisfaction are
quite closely related. If there wasn't at least a perception of quality,
there'd be no repeat business. Without repeat business, there is no
profitability. So yes, the fact that a carrier is financially stable does
reflect to great extent customer satisfaction. I do agree with you
that cost per seat mile is a bit hard to tie into the scale, though..
Again, the airline couldn't afford to have a larger fleet unless there
was some cash behind it, and cash comes from repeat business. Would you
say that the number of McDonalds franchises is a reflection on the
success of the company and its profitability? Yes. Does the fact that
they have a lot of franchises mean that they provide quality? Indirectly,
yes. Because there is a demand for their product, they open more stores
to meet that demand. The same thing with an airline. AA is not the same
airline it was 10 years ago, and its fleet is almost twice as large as it
was 10 years ago. They improved the delivery of their product over this
period, and as a result of the customer demand, was able to expand.
With expansion came new aircraft. Same for UA and DL. As quality drops,
demand falls off, the company shrinks and eventually fails. Like Pan Am
did and MarkAir is in the process of doing as we speak.
Ok. Prove your stronger argument. I don't see it as completely
meaningless considering that sustained growth into new markets and
increases in capacity/productivity are usually strong rating points on
anyone's scale, such as Wall Street....
Given that the CRTL ranks TW, NW and US above AA, UA and DL, I'd be a bit
more concerned if the AQR followed the CRTL's criteria... Despite my
obvious bias towards one of the carriers here, I've flown on all of the
carriers ranked. I can't see how even on a bad day for UA and a good day
for NW where the rankings would fall as they did...
The even more misguided CRTL ranks them in this order:
:  NW    TW    US    AA    DL    HP    UA    WN    CO
Tell me how anyone can seriously say that UA and WN rank lower than
everyone but CO?... The credibility of this ranking is somewhat lacking.
DL had its fair share of awards in the 1990 Japan Case, as did UA. AA was
left out on this one. Admittedly, AA has fared better in Europe and South
America than they have in the Pacific route cases, but their market
share is also much stronger in the central and east states, which is
where most of the US-Europe traffic originates, and where most of the
Europe-US traffic is destined for.
They also have more residents and businesses. Just because there is a hub
at SLC doesn't mean that there is enough demand for an air route to
London. Public convenience means service the markets with the demand, not
serving one because of a geographical location or perceived disadvantage.
As hard as routes into the UK are to secure, the DOT decided that the
public was better served by leaving the routes on the east coast where
the demand is. Had DL bid to move a route to JFK to LGW, they probably
would have been awarded it. By choosing SLC, they put themself at a
disadvantage.
Personally, I'm not too fond of Cathay Pacific's management, and I do
agree with you that CX and the Hong Kong government (wrt aviation policy)
are definitely not pro-competition.  Nevertheless, they have a good reason
for limiting capacity/rights to HKG because Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport has
long reached its full capacity.  Although talks of building a new airport
at Chek Lap Kok started as early as mid 70's, it was not feasible at the
time because landing at CLK would require the use of the Chinese air space.
(At the time, China was not an open society, and airlines from many
countries would have problem using the airport.)  Thus, CX has the
"monopoly" at Kai Tak more or less by default.
4000 seats a week aren't that many.  However, there is no reciprocating
fifth-freedom benefit for CX, hence, CX thinks it's doing Qantas a favor
by letting QF picking up pax in HKG to BKK/SIN (and perhaps to Europe).
Airlines like Malaysia, Thai, and even Singapore have been offer
below-market (actually, should be below-CX) European fares from HKG.
Therefore, I don't think QF's European traffic is the thing that really
pisses CX off.
Well, I have to argue with you on this one.  Cathay has been very conscious
about its cost.  It has moved some of its operations from Hong Kong to
reduce costs.  The management was very aggressive in making the cockpit
and cabin crews to accept longer working hours and reduced benefits.  The
aggressiveness resulted in a walkout by the cabin crew during Chinese New
Year of 1993.  However, the management was firm with its position and the
cabin crew gave in.  CX is one the lowest cost operators among major East
Asian airlines even though doing business in Hong Kong is very expensive.
Well, the L1011 utilization is not a very good example for at least two
reasons:
I think you're a little bit harsh on HK.  HK has one of the freest markets
in the world.  Do not extrapolate HK's conservative aviation policies to
general trading policies.  The Hong Kong Aviation Authority may be
anti-competition, but the Australian government has been practicing
protectionism for a long long time.  To cite a few Australian
anti-competition aviation policies that I can remember:
Well, to be truthful, adenoids ARE your tonsils.  Or, to be more
specific, are tonsilar tissue in your nasopharynx, as opposed to your
oropharynx.  But, I still agree that I wouldn't want a 777 in my nose
flying at 10,000 feet.
Next question.  Who is paying for all of these flights?  And who is
flying the planes?  UA pilots who are going to be using them, or Boeing emps?
And onto the CRJ.  And this is a tad out of the scope of this newsgroup,
I admit....  But I was at the (shocker) airport last night, and saw a CRJ
take off.  From PIT.  Anyway, it left on a left parallel runway, and made
what is probabally a standard 5 degree left turn soon after take off, but
then was pretty much straight.  To get to the point, the plane just left
its gear down for a VERY long time... like until I could barely make out
its outline.  What's the deal?  Were the pilots just asleep or is this
standard?  And also, what's the deal with winglets?  Boeing nixed them on
the 777 saying they were not fuel cost effective --the weight of adding
additional pylons for their installation were offset by any aerodynamic
benefits from having less powerful wing vortecies (sp).  So, why is the
CRJ built this way?  Why was it cost-effective for them?
I addressed this in my original post, but let me summarize here.  I
agree that new aircraft have greater fuel efficiency and reduced
reliability/ maintenance costs.  At the same time, a new 100-120 seat
airplane (read: 737, MD-80, or 320 series) costed around $30,000,000
(last time I checked - around 1991) and the cost of hush-kitting an
older airplane like a 727 or DC-9 costs around $3,000,000 (again,
these figures were approximate in 1991).  Thus, the increased fuel
efficiency and reduced reliability/maintenance costs are *dwarfed* by
the ~$25,000,000 savings of using hush kits over new aircraft.  When I
worked at Northwest, there was a study floating around that made the
calculations and showed the savings to keep the old aircraft flying.
I wish I had a copy of this.
As the original poster noted, this savings is especially true for the
DC-9s which tend to age better than the B-727 or B-737.  This explains
why Northwest and Valujet are holding onto a fleet of old DC-9s.  (As
someone noted to me in a private email, Valujet's fleet is
*exclusively* a DC-9 fleet).
As a former AA employee I can understand your confusion.  First of all the
choices for the PHL/BWI/CLT-LGW.  This decision was based on Several
factors including European base companies with locations in the cities
that had applied for route transfer.  RDU has 154 European companies, BNA
has 74, SLC 26.  The DOT was looking at the highest producing revenue
cities verses "vacation/tourist" travel.  I have friends who still work
for AA and say that RDU-LGW always goes out full in busness and most if
not all are full fare revenue and not AAdvantage Upgrades.  When the
bilaterial agreed to new US gateways, the DOT decided that one should be
and stay in the Carolinias.  This bilaterial also stated all new US
carriers would service LGW.  The PHL-LON was a TW route that DOT did not
grant to AA when they purchased the LHR routes for TW.  When US purchased
it because they were limited to LGW the route tranfered to LGW.  When AA
was awarded the route they were able to switch back to LHR as that was
where the route was when it was first granted and they had service to LHR.
USAir has no intentions of selling its 76's, and never did.  They
announced this a while back, however, as a threat to its unions.
Meanwhile, they were applying for BOS-FRA and Bos-ORY.
But we're not evaluating the public's "perception" of quality.  The
public's perception of quality is based on alot of different factors,
which would indeed include financial stability, frequency of flights,
etc.
However, we're trying to evaluate the *actual* quality in some objective
manner.  The actual quality of an airline is not determined by how
the public perceives them.  In particular, the financial stability is
(can be?) orthogonal to the service quality.
Again, larger airlines are *perceived* to have a better product.  That
does not mean that their product *is* any better.
To use your example, McDonald's may be big, yes.  But that doesn't mean
that their product is better than, say, Bob's Corner Hamburger Saloon.
It just means that Bob's Saloon hasn't been recognized by the market for
it's high-quality burgers.
The fact is that measuring fleet size gives an unfair advantage to
larger carriers, at the expense of smaller carriers who may still be
providing a superior product.
If we just wanted to measure how people perceive airline quality, a
Gallop poll would do just fine.
HNL seems to have been under construction now for well over 10 years.
What we jokingly called the "dignified welfare project" seems to be
true: when the original contractor won the bid, the project was
supposed to be small and self-contained. Over the years, the SAME
contractor continued to ask for "extensions" on the original contract.
Basically, we started with a palm-lined, single-tower airport to a
"modernized" airport (Smart Carte and all) that is always under
renovation.
The worst joke of all was the whole inter-island terminal fiasco.
Aloha & Hawaiian used to have a separate area--and when a third
carrier (oooh, was it Mid-Pac? They so come and go) wanted to share
the space, it got the big cold shoulder. So it managed to get counter
space at the main terminal--and all of a sudden a lot of people
decided that was a good idea (no need to wait for the Wikiwiki
Shuttle). That irked Aloha & Haw'n to no end...and after a lot of
wrangling and shuffling, Haw'n built its own one-story terminal near
Nimitz Highway. Aloha didn't like that--so they prompted an entire
renovation of its old terminal. Now, we have a huge, ugly parking
edifice (for inter-island all-day parkers, I guess) for Aloha--and
Haw'n operates out of it too (don't ask what happened to its old "new"
terminal--I think it got hand-me-downed to the smaller
island-hoppers).
To make a long story short (and to bring this to the original thread),
a recent state audit finally revealed what a sweet-heart deal the
original contractor had gotten itself for the last decade. Of course,
being that this is Hawaii, I wouldn't be surprised if the contractor
continues to "upgrade and renovate" HNL for another 10 years on the
same original contract it got the bid for back in the early '80s.
Our local newspaper had an article today on an in-flight shutdown of
a B767 engine:
ATC lost radio contact with a UA jetliner over the North Altlantic as
the Boeing 767, having lost one of its two engines, headed on an
emergency course for Bermuda and flew too low to communicate with the
controller's antiquated radios. Contact with the airliner was lost for
stretches of 8-10 minutes or longer. Controllers say that if the plane
had been forced to ditch in the water, they would not have had a precise
location to send rescuers.
A private subcontractor, Aeronautical Radio Inc., was used to relay radio
messages between the airliner and the ATC. The company transcribes
reports and then transmits them by teletype to the Controllers at he
FAA's New York Center. The controllers keep track of locations in their
heads, or use grease pencils on Plexiglas!!!!
The incident itself was as follows: the pilot was flying at 33000 ft
about 330 miles south of Bermuda when he radioed that he had a possible
oil filter blockage in one engine and asked for permission to descend to
25000 ft. The controller on duty received the information on teletype,
telephoned Aeronautical Radio, and asked to be patched through to the
plane. -- that took 5 minutes and was considered to be pretty quick!
The pilot later reported that the engine had shut down. The pilot had to
descend to unusually low altitudes because of a loss in cabin pressure.
The shut-down of one engine meant the loss of an air conditioning unit,
and the remaining unit overheated.
Newsweek had an article just last week on the antiquated ATC equipment!
Fortunately, the plane was in constant contact with United's own
dispatchers in Chicago, via satellite link.
Which immediately led me to think ETOPS.  However, later reports said
the flight was UA 987, JFK-GRU (Sau Paulo, Brazil), which does not
require ETOPS even though it does use ETOPS-rated equipment.
Except, as you note later, the aircraft was in constant contact with
United in Chicago via more modern communications equipment, and thus
its position was known and could have been communicated to resuce
operations should it have been forced to ditch.  The whole article
seemed rather stilted to me, with the real problem (archaic radio for
trans-oceanic ATC) lost in hysteria.
Yeeesh!  Those Tejas folk get some serious hail!
Hard to see otherwise, unless the hail was restriced to buildings 2E & 3E.
If it made it over to 4E, Delta must have noticed it.
Unless I am misinterpreting the question here, isn't any airline with a
hub-based routing system vulnerable to whatever weather the hub is
subject to?
On filghts in/out of ORD,  United seems to have plenty of planes in
there at any given time.  And of course UA has major a hub operation
at Denver - an extreme-and-unpredicable weather center if ever there
were one.  Hmm.. it might even be only a matter of time before HP gets
bit by duststorms at Sky Harbor or McCarren.  (Would dust in the intake
take a plane out of service?  I'm out of my experience on that one?)
The Kobe earthquake is a very bad comparison.  We haven't seen major
damages to the United fleet at SFO during the 1989 Loma Prieta quake,
or to aircrafts at LAX during the 1994 Northridge quake.  Besides, if
an earthquake strikes the Tokyo / Yokohama / Narita area, about the
last thing I would worry about is damages to the JAL and ANA fleet at
NRT.
40% of HK's flights go to China, I think it is definitely an exaggeration.
Although, traffic between HK and China is huge, many services are to
secondary points which do not warrant the use of wide-body aircraft.
One or two weekly flights for CX vs two daily flights for QF.  I don't
think CX will consider their fifth-freedom rights as "reciprocating".
In terms of traffic, none of the fifth-freedom rights you mentioned are
comparable to HKG/SIN and HKG/BKK.  However, I do have to agree with
Qantas that CX can carry passengers from Australia to almost anywhere in
Asia and Europe (through six-freedom rights), so why can't QF carry
passengers from HKG to places other than Australia?
You are citing an exception rather than the norm.  Even if they pay some
pilots over US$300K, CX is still one of the lower cost operator in East
Asia.
I'm not too fond of Cathay's management nor the British colonial
administrators.  Cathay has mostly been run by Brits (some Australians
and few Chinese) even though it is supposedly the airline of Hong Kong
in where 98% of the population are Chinese.  (They didn't even put their
Chinese name on the aircraft, because they said that would hurt their
image).  Because of their British arrogance and discriminatory practices,
I try to avoid flying CX as much as possible.  Nevertheless, both the HK
Colonial Government and Cathay have made significant contributions to the
prosperity of HK (and made of a lot money for themselves, too).
BTW, the Chinese name of Cathay is literally translated as "a prosperous
and peaceful nation."  Let's hope the prosperity will last even after
1997.
Thought some of y'all would like to know the average meal costs per
passenger (all classes, I guess) for the different lines, based on the 3
months ending 9/30/94:
(From the 4/30/95 Dallas Morning News)
So what's all this mean?  I don't know, because there are so many
variables that need to be considered.  Ones I can think of include:
      -Average flight length (short hauls cheaper)
      -Relative fares/expected service (Southwest: did anyone expect them
       to be higher?)
      -Int'l vs. domestic food service (People expect more Int'l, I think)
      -Whether costs are being cut by increasing efficiency or reducing food
On that last note,  The book _Frequent Flyer_ (by Bob Reiss), describes
some of the results when Delta asked their employees for cost cutting
suggestions:
   "A flight attendant had suggested eliminating a decorative piece
of lettuce in meal service.  Management was amazed to learn the savings
exceeded $1.4 million a year.  A food service employee modified a machine
to cut cakes into fourteen instead of thirteen pieces.  A flight
attendant designed a new way to package napkins.  By perforating the
packs they came in, they could be removed one at a time, and the unused
napkins saved instead of thrown out after each flight...."
(side note:  What did those more knowledgeable than I think about that
book?)
Once again, airlines are walking the cost/service tightrope, trying to
cut costs without losing customers.

I hope the recent rows between the US and Chinese governments will not
affect the outcome of this order.
IMHO, the future of the A340 is better than the A330.  There will
always be airlines which will be uncomfortable operating long-range
twins.  For example, Thai International, with 8 B777-200As and 6
B777-300s on order, will not consider the B777-200B to replace the
MD-11s.
Interestingly that you brought up the subject.  I've previously discussed
this subject with Mr. Jennings through e-mail, too.  A few days ago, I
posted an "analysis" of the A330 program to sci.aeronautics.airliners
and cross-posted to m.t.a.  Well, we'll have to wait for Karl to approve
it. :-(.
SIA is looking for a regional jet, hence, the MD-11 is definitely out of
the question.  Furthermore, SIA does not have a good track record with MD,
or, perhaps I should say MD does not have a good track record with SIA.
SIA dumped the DC-10 after ~ 5 years of operation.  SIA did not even take
the delivery of the last two (of seven) aircraft and sold them directly to
Varig.  Around 1990, SIA signed an MOU with MD to order up to 20 MD-11s.
At the time, one of the major reasons for the order was because both Delta
and Swissair (SIA's cross-equity partners) had ordered the MD-11s.  Later,
MD and P&W failed to guarantee certain performance, and SIA switched to
the A340.  Currently, SIA has 17 A340s on order (plus 20 options) for
long-haul services.  Thus, on paper, the A330 is the more likely
candidate, and Airbus made a news release a few weeks ago claiming that
they were ahead of Boeing in the SIA competition.  Last year, Boeing was
ready to lease eight B777s to SIA, and SIA's chairman was reported to say
that the deal was too sweet to refuse.  I believe the lease offer is still
on.
As I said it before, the edge apparently goes to Airbus, but I believe
Boeing has a good chance.
I don't know whether the Japanese contents in the B777 will affect SIA's
decision, but I believe Singapore Aerospace is a subcontractor of the B777
program, too.  IMHO, the B777 is better sized for the Asian market.  If I
were an SIA executive, I would have picked the B777.  The B777-200 may be
a little too big to replace some of SIA's A310s (so is the A330, and SIA
is reported to be looking for a smaller aircraft later on).  However, the
B777-300 is the most ideal aircraft to replace the B747s used for regional
services.  SIA's order is important to the A330 program, but I would not
go so far to say it's a make-or-break order for the A330.  The A330
program still has some other potential customers.  (See my up-coming
"analysis", if you are interested.)
747s are not good choices for short/mid-length domestic flights and are
essentially unused for such in the U.S.  In fact, most of the city pairs
you'e named above are dominated by flights on 757s, 737s, 767s, and
DC10s.  SFO-ORD and SFO-JFK have only a few flights on 747s, and these
are positioning flights for continuing international flights.
The 747 is a horrible choice for the intra-Japan flights, and the only
reason they use them there is because Narita cannot be expanded to
accomodate the number of flights that would be needed to properly handle
these flights with 737s or similar aircraft.
As promised, the list of world airport traffic and growth.  From Airport
Council International.  PAX are in millions, and are arriving, plus departing,
plus in transit counted once.  Big airports not reporting to the ACI include
the Chinese airports:  Beijing, 10.3 M, Guangzhou, 9.2 M, Shanghai 7.6 M.
To add a little spice, I include my comments.  In general I'd say the growth
in US traffic is phenomenal, with the low-cost entrants making a big splash.
Compare with the nearly static numbers for Canada, for instance.
European airport traffic growth is also pretty sedate.
Las Vegas, for instance, is in serious danger of cracking the top 10 airports
in the world in the near future if it can maintain even half its growth.

Top 20 Cargo Airports in the World
Not for several years.  UA is still performing "D" maintenance checks
on its 72's.  That means at least another four years of flying.  I
suspect, for UA, at least, the phase-out will coincide with Boeing's
announcement of a twin-engine plane in the 150 passenger range.
