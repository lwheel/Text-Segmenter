1. Why is it that US carriers going trans-pacific don't seem to be as
   favorable in the eyes of Asian travelers? It seems that somehow US
   carriers do not offer the same type of service, or at least, the level
   of service is not comparable to that of Asian carriers.
2. On trans-pacific flights, is it normal to have a refueling stop during
   winter? Last Christmas I flew on a China Airlines flight to Taipei, and
   had to stop over in Anchorage for refueling.  Noting that it was a
   747-400, I thought the -400 was supposed to be able to fly non-stop...
3. Why is it that such airlines like Singapore, Cathay Pacifi, and China
   are able to post profits year after year while US carriers are
   suffering? In fact...they give more to the passengers while the fare is
   often lower than US carriers...
Hmm...if only I can remember all of the things I have wanted to ask...
Anyhow....One more thing..I flew on a new Taiwanese carrier called EVA
Airways last summer...in their Economy Deluxe class, and thought it was
the most excellent...Has anyone else flew on them? What do you think? and
is their service similar to that of Virgin Atlantic's?
1) California was Strategicaly Important to UA
2) California has good densities.
1. * The 737-300/400/500 is kept under one column (345).
2. The engine selection (other than the A340, B737, MD80 and 90) is
   indicated by the letter behind each order number.  C,G,I,P, or R stands
   for CFMI, GEAE, IAE, P&W, or R-R, respectively; U for undecided/unknown.
3. If the MD95 is launched, the statistics will be kept under the MD90, and
   B will be used for BMW-R-R's BR715 engine.
4. Send an e-mail to me (chuanga@iia2.org) for any order that I have left out.
   Make sure the orders are announced firm orders with a verifiable source.

  - 18 747s -- Presumably the entire 747-100 fleet, which includes
	13 ancient 747-122s that United bought new and another three
	even more elderly, ex-American 747-123s.  The article claims
	these aircraft won't meet noise standards, yet the seven ex-
	Qantas 747-238Bs aren't much better.
  - 31 DC-10s -- I'm afraid I've lost track of how many DC-10s United
	has retired thus far.  This undoubtedly covers the entire
	DC-10-10 fleet, but I'm not sure if it includes the eight-
	member DC-10-30 fleet or not.  The latter aircraft are based
	in Honolulu, I believe, and except for HNL-ORD non-stops and
	occasional trips to SFO for maintenance they mainly fly to
	and within Southeast Asia.
  - 45 737-200s -- All of the remaining 737-222s, but not the 24-
	member fleet of 737-200 Advanced aircraft acquired from the
	original Frontier in the late 1980s.
(1)  Southwest likes short-haul markets
(2)  There are virtually no significant DEN markets under 400 miles
(3)  Continental REALLY REALLY wanted to be like Mike, uh, I mean Southwest
(4)  Continental abaondons their oldest hub on the misguided notion that
     low-cost carriers like WN can't make money between 450-900 miles, so
     neither can they.
      -	strong US economy

	(1) Antiquated air traffic control system
		Some aspects of our system date to prewar times, such as
		pilots flying over the Atlantic using high frequency radios
		to speak to controllers in Islip to report flight progress
		through a third party, thus slowing response time considerably,
		becasue the FAA lacks equipment that can follow a plane acros
		the Atlantic.
	(2) Wind Shear
		A problem that can be treated by the installation of Doppler
		Radar Systems (TDWR), but has been hindered by environmental as
		well as political oppostion.  Doppler Technology is only in
		place at IAH, MEM, and STL.  The FAA says that 47 additional
		Dopplers will be working by 1996.
	(3) Ice Buildup/Problems with De-Icing
		Ground delays causing ice buildup even after the aircraft has
		been de-iced because the chemical only protects the wings for
		fifteen minutes.  Problems with commuter aircraft is discussed
		as well.
	(4) Terrorism
		Yesterday's bombing in Oklahoma City is just another example of
		how vunerable the United States is to terrorist attacks.  The
		article maintains that it is very easy for a terrorist to bomb
		a domestic flight, but suggests that they may not realize how
		easy it is.  Technology to fight this would cost ridiculous
		amounts of money.
	(5) Conflicts Between "Man and Machine"
		A certain aircraft manufacturer whose name starts with an "A"
		was mentioned several times in this section, with a United
		pilot being quoted as saying "Why did it do that" in refrence
		to an action performed by his aircraft.
	(6) Ground Collisions/Traffic
		This topic ties into the first one, the fact that controllers
		lack equipment that can warn them of possible ground
		collisions.  The window is the only way a controller can see
		aircraft on the ground now, and radar systems are being
		pointed to as a method of warning controllers of impending
		accidents.  This technology is also very expensive, and has
		some oppostion within the FAA.
	(1) immediate modernization of the Air Traffic Control System,
	(2) taking control of the FAA away from Congress,
	(3) make the FAA enforce safety issues only, not economic ones,
	(4) improve flight data recording devices,
	(5) set higher standards for pilots,
	(6) increase the number of controllers,
	(7) eliminate "lap rides" for children under two and require
	    safety seats for children,
	(8) improve airport security,
	(9) get Doppler technology up and running where it is most needed
	    immediately, and
	(10) listen to what fliers want.  According to a Newsweek poll, 71%
	    of fliers would pay higher fares for safety improvements, and
	    94% of those surveyed said they would tolerate delays and
	    cancellations in favor of higher safety standards.
1. SJC-NRT has not required a load restriction or fuel stop for several
years. Even on a bad day.... The runway was extended and MDC worked out
some of the range problems.
2. Latin America is one of the fastest expanding markets. Keep watching
it as their economies grow and the rest of the world is still faltering.
3. AA got PHL-LHR because they originally bought the authority from TWA, and
were not allowed to pick up the authority in 1991. They also paid for
STL-LHR and ended up having to give it back (without a refund!) to TWA.
4. The traffic justified both routes, as did the community and civic
support (a trick learned from UAL's bid for ORD-NRT). With the amount of
high-tech and offshore manufacturing in both TN and NC, there was demand
and commitments to use the service. I didn't see that in DL's bid, aside
>from  the alleged support of the Mormon church....
1. CX's L1011s are used just like the B737/MD80 are used by US carriers.
   Most of the sectors served by CX's L1011s are between 1.5 hours to 3.5
   hours.  Furthermore, many East Asian airports have night curfews.
   Therefore, 6-9 hours of utilization are not unreasonable.  CX is
   definitely not alone in this category.  If you check out TG's, MH's,
   CI's A300 and SQ's A310 utilizations, you'll find CX's L1011 number is
   not low.  Actually, CX has been very good in keeping high utilization
   of its long-haul aircraft.  When CX got its first few B747s in 1979/80,
   I was shocked that the average B747 utilization for CX was around 16
   hours a day!
2. CX's L1011s are fully depreciated, thus, they can afford to collect
   some dust (remember there are many more L1011s in the deserts that are
   not generating a single cent of revenue).  I believe CX also operate a
   lot of extra and "chartered" flights.  For example, supplement flights
   are quite common on the HKG-TPE run.
1. In early 80s, it tried to limit Southeast Asian carriers' six-freedom
   rights from Australia to Europe (Kangaroo route).  (This is the only
   incidence that I can remember a government made a _major_ effort to
   impose limit on six-freedom rights.)
2. in 1993, NW's OSA-SYD fiasco,
3. and the recent unilateral suspension of a free market agreement
   with New Zealand.
